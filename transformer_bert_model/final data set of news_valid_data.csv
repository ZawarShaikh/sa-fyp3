671,"John McCain survived brutal torture and six years as a prisoner of war during Vietnam. If Donald Trump thinks he can intimidate him, he should think again.On Friday, the Arizona senator released a statement announcing his intention to vote against the Graham-Cassidy bill that Republicans have introduced to repeal Obamacare.The bill would strip healthcare from 30 million Americans, and turn Medicaid into a block grant program that would cease to exist after a few years. The bill also gives states the power to obtain waivers so that insurance companies can discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions. America s healthcare system would be thrown into dire chaos, and Trump is absolutely okay with that.McCain is not.The issue is too important, and too many lives are at risk, for us to leave the American people guessing from one election to the next whether and how they will acquire health insurance. A bill of this impact requires a bipartisan approach.Senators Alexander and Murray have been negotiating in good faith to fix some of the problems with Obamacare. But I fear that the prospect of one last attempt at a strictly Republican bill has left the impression that their efforts cannot succeed. I hope they will resume their work should this last attempt at a partisan solution fail.I cannot in good conscience vote for the Graham-Cassidy proposal. I believe we could do better working together, Republicans and Democrats, and have not yet really tried. Nor could I support it without knowing how much it will cost, how it will effect insurance premiums, and how many people will be helped or hurt by it. Without a full CBO score, which won t be available by the end of the month, we won t have reliable answers to any of those questions.And for that, Trump viciously attacked McCain.John McCain never had any intention of voting for this Bill, which his Governor loves. He campaigned on Repeal & Replace. Let Arizona down!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 23, 2017Arizona had a 116% increase in ObamaCare premiums last year, with deductibles very high. Chuck Schumer sold John McCain a bill of goods. Sad  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 23, 2017Large Block Grants to States is a good thing to do. Better control & management. Great for Arizona. McCain let his best friend L.G. down!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 23, 2017First off, block grants are not enough to cover all the people who desperately need healthcare. In fact, it limits funding to the point where state officials will have to decide who gets care and who doesn t to avoid using up the grant money on expensive treatments, which sounds a lot like a death panel.Second, Lindsey Graham s friendship with McCain does not mean they vote the same, as Graham made clear on Twitter.My friendship with @SenJohnMcCain is not based on how he votes but respect for how he s lived his life and the person he is.  Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) September 22, 2017Obamacare has its flaws, but those flaws can be fixed easily with bipartisan legislation. McCain understands this and he understands that repealing Obamacare would leave tens of millions of Americans without healthcare, including millions of conservatives in red states.Donald Trump is an asshole. He wants to kill a major healthcare law just because it is known as Obamacare and because he is desperate for major legislation to sign. He hasn t even actually read the damn bill, which medical organizations and the healthcare industry agree is terrible.Besides, if Trump wanted McCain s vote so much he should have thought of that before criticizing him for being a POW.Featured Image: Alex Wong/Getty Images",0
705,"Mexican President Enrique Pe a Nieto was scheduled to meet with Trump on January 31, but that isn t happening anymore.

355,"The drip drip drip of communism in the leftist state of California A new California law scheduled to take effect Friday will allow the police to seize private, legally-owned weapons for up to three weeks without charges or allowing the citizen to contest the seizure.AB1014 was passed last year in the wake of 2014 s Isla Vista shooting, where teenager Elliot Rodger went on a rampage near the campus of the University of California, Santa Barbara, killing six people along with himself.Rodger s parents had reported him to the police prior to the shooting, concerned about his mental health and rants he posted online. But after meeting with Rodger, police decided he wasn t a criminal risk, and consequently didn t search his apartment, where he was stockpiling weapons and ammunition.The new law is intended to stop such a situation from re-occurring. Under the law, a judge has the power to grant a restraining order telling police to seize a person s guns, based solely on accounts from family members or police that the person is poses an imminent danger to others. The restraining order can be granted without the affected person knowing it exists or being allowed time to contest it.Under the law, the factors a judge can consider in granting the restraining order include not only threats of violence, but also prior felony arrests (even without a conviction), evidence of alcohol abuse, and even the simple act of recently purchasing a gun or ammunition.Once granted, police can use the restraining order to confiscate all of a person s guns and ammunition, and the person is also barred from buying or possessing guns and ammo for the duration of the order. A full court hearing must then be heard within three weeks. At that hearing, a judge will be able to extend the restraining order for an entire year. The law gives us a vehicle to cause the person to surrender their weapons, to have a time out, if you will,  Los Angeles Police Department Assistant Chief Michael Moore told Southern California Public Radio.  It allows further examination of the person s mental state. The law expands on California gun laws that are already some of the country s toughest. Police already have the power to seize a person s guns if a licensed therapist informs them that the person s mental state makes them a danger to themselves or others. Via: Daily Caller ",0
1205,"Things got a bit uncomfortable during Rick Perry s confirmation hearing for a position in a department he forgot existed, then wanted to eliminate, and literally just learned what it does. Now he wants to run it. I have learned a great deal about the important work being done every day by the outstanding men and women of the DOE,  Perry said in his opening statement at his confirmation hearing.  My past statements made over five years ago about abolishing the Department of Energy do not reflect my current thinking. In fact, after being briefed on so many of the vital functions of the Department of Energy, I regret recommending its elimination. The thought of Rick Perry being in charge of our nation s nuclear stockpile is terrifying, but we were treated to a rare bit of levity during the former Texas Governor s exchange with Senator Al Franken.The Senator thanked Trump s nominee for recently visiting him in his office.  Did you enjoy meeting me?  Franken joked. That s when things got weird. Perry uttered a sentence that will almost assuredly be memed for months or even years to come: I hope you are as much fun on that dais as you were on your couch. May I rephrase that?  Perry asked. Please. Please. Please,  Franken replied.  Oh my lord. Oh my lord. Watch it for yourself, below:Featured image via screengrab",0

1019,"History has shown that one of the most cost-effective ways to project your dissatisfaction when attending a large organized protest is to go to an army surplus shop, buy a cheap M-65 field jacket for around $25 and some sharpies. Not only will the jacket keep you warm during the colder months, you can customize it to get the exact message you want across, all the while having that badass Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver vibe about you.The only problem with that approach is that customizing the jacket takes a combination of effort and creativity and not all of us have the time or the skills to pull it off   some of us are just too lazy. Fortunately for those who fit into either of those demographics, Barneys New York are now stocking the Alpha Industries  Anarchy  jacket for am extortionate outlay of $375. Sure, it may be kind of generic and not express exactly what is on your mind, but the general sentiment is there, I guess.So, what do you get for $375? As the Barneys website describes it, the  Alpha Industries  M-65 field jacket is constructed of olive cotton-blend canvas. This military-inspired piece is detailed with assorted handwritten graffiti, a checked pattern pocket, and anarchy symbols at the front and back. Alpha Industries were initially a contractor for the US Military and according to Angelyn Fernandez, their VP of Product, self-expression was the inspiration behind this piece. We have seen resistance to power and authority become a trend in our current pop culture and society, often expressed through fashion,  she said.  Since 1965 the M-65 field jackets have been a favored method to graphically express one s opinion. We developed the Barneys M-65 anarchy jacket to encompass the artistic and graphic expressions of individuality. There were just two major flaws in Ms. Fernadez s plan, the first being that the statements on the jacket can t really be deemed an  expression of individuality  if they are mass produced and sold for an enormous profit. The second is that the key demographic for whom she was aiming generally tend to shun capitalism. Those exact people, however, have embraced social media and many took to Twitter to show their lack of appreciation for the piece, many to hilarious effect.*swipes platinum Amex card *""Welcome to the resistance""  panamaorange (@panamaorange) November 3, 2017FIGHT THE POWER!

1103,"If you ve recently gotten into an online political debate, it s likely that you ve encountered some people claiming to be former Democrats who are now supporting Trump. Many Democrats dismiss these people as trolls, and as it turns out, they are probably right. There is a giant epidemic of people (mostly two users) spouting the exact same verbiage throughout social media.Does this sound familiar?I come from a family of Democrats and switched to Republican to over for Mr. Trump! My 80 year old father who s been a life time (sic) Democrat is voting for Donald Trump!Here it is, twice, from two different users:I suppose that could be a coincidence, in a parallel universe, but a quick Google search shows that it s not. Both Kim Smith and Daniel Mazurkiewicz show up dozens of times with the exact same quote. Here s just a sample of the Google results:It s not just Facebook. There is also this:There are also a string of fans of that particular comment:A look at their Facebook pages reveals something kind of strange. Daniel Mazurkiewicz s first post was in April. His image is a watermarked Getty Images picture. Smith appears to have disappeared.There are a couple of possible explanations. One is that these people are classic paid internet trolls. It was revealed just the other day that the Kremlin is behind a massive troll campaign to help boost the billionaire.In his research from St. Petersburg, (freelance journalist Adrian) Chen discovered that Russian internet trolls   paid by the Kremlin to spread false information on the internet   have been behind a number of  highly coordinated campaigns  to deceive the American public.It s a brand of information warfare, known as  dezinformatsiya,  that has been used by the Russians since at least the Cold War. The disinformation campaigns are only one  active measure  tool used by Russian intelligence to  sow discord among,  and within, allies perceived hostile to Russia.Source: Business InsiderIt s not just Russians, though. Trump has paid people to cheer for him. Trump has also been his own cheerleader, by posing as his PR people in the past. In other words, there s a good chance that  Kim Smith  and  Daniel Mazurkiewicz  are, in fact, Donald Trump posing as his supporters.Featured image via John Moore at Getty Images.",0
2,"White House officials are now saying Trump won t make a trip to England this summer after a hurried, secret plan to sneak the president into the country was leaked to the English press causing widespread outrage.Trump s unpopularity in the United Kingdom is legendary, and his aversion to protesters has caused him to refuse to visit the nation until they can guarantee there won t be mass protests. But his staff apparently came up with a gamble that would allow him to meet with British Prime Minister Theresa May while avoiding the backlash. Unfortunately for him, it fell through almost immediately.Trump wanted to visit his golf course in Scotland (because, of course) while he was in Europe for the G20 meeting and the plan was to have him quietly pop over to London so he could meet with May. To avoid any chance of protests, Trump s staff is said to have warned British officials that the president would only be giving 24-hour notice before dropping by. This way, they reasoned, protesters wouldn t even know he was in the country before he was leaving again.Whitehall sources confirmed the government had been warned that the president could visit Turnberry, one of his two golf resorts in Scotland, during his trip to Europe, between attending the G20 summit in Hamburg and joining celebrations for Bastille Day in France on 14 July.Trump would be expected to come to Downing Street to meet the prime minister for informal talks as part of any such visit, though final confirmation would be likely to be given with just 24 hours  notice to minimise the risk of disruption.But like everything with Trump s flailing administration, the plan leaked to the press and protesters vowed to be ready, even at short notice.So the White House is back to saying he won t be visiting our ally after all. At least not this summer.A spokeswoman for the US president said on Monday that no trip was imminent, amid mounting speculation that Trump was planning to make an unofficial visit to the UK on his way to or from the G20 summit in Hamburg this week. While we look forward to visiting the UK, it will not happen in the next two weeks,  the spokeswoman said.It s doubtful that the White House s denials are going to make any would-be protesters put their guard down. The Trump administration has such a deep reputation of lying, that a denial from them means absolutely nothing. It s likely that angry English citizens will gather at Trump s Scottish golf course while Trump is in Europe juussstttt in case. And Trump has a notoriously hard time resisting a game of golf.Meanwhile, Trump is getting ready to meet his on-again, off-again friend Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit. His advisers told CNN that the president is not planning to bring up the fact that Russia hacked the U.S. elections. Nevertheless, it will certainly be the elephant in the room.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",0

1106,"For the past week since Trump struck one of his alleged  solid gold  deals to keep Carrier from moving to Mexico, we ve seen what is probably the most pathetic victory lap from a president-elect in U.S. history. Between lying through his teeth about what the deal entailed, then unleashing multiple Twitter rants targeting Carrier s union president when he was called out on it, his behavior has not been what most would consider presidential, to say the least!Thursday night, during his segment  A Closer Look,  Seth Meyers took the opportunity to dig deep into the deceptive Carrier deal and discovered that hardly any of what Trump is bragging about adds up. So Trump first claimed he would stop Carrier from moving jobs to Mexico, then claimed he was saving over 1,100 jobs and then it turned out he was saving only 730 which The Washington Post reports is just 37 percent of the total who were due to leave the state. Meyers points out that while saving those 730 jobs is likely a big relief to the families of those workers, it isn t nearly good enough compared to what was promised   and to add to that, the hypocrisy from the right regarding this so-called deal is astounding! Despite its many flaws, there s no denying the deal was politically popular. But for Republicans, what s so surprising about this new policy of strong-arming companies into making business decisions is that the GOP has spent eight years calling Obama a  socialist  for his economic policies. Remember how they reacted to the auto bailout, which saved as many as 1.5 million jobs  They accused him of coercion and hijacking capitalism. Well, as you might have guessed, they see the Carrier deal a little differently. Watch it all unfold here:Featured image via video screenshot",0

1055,"The Republican favorite in Alabama s Senate race next month is being accused of inappropriate sexual conduct with a 14-year-old girl in 1979, The Washington Post reports. It s not just one child that the uber-Conservative Christian is accused of approaching when he was in his 30s, but the newspaper also found three other women who said that Roy Moore had approached them around a similar time when they were between the ages of 16 and 18.Leigh Corfman says she was 14 years old when Moore, then 32-years-old, approached her outside a courtroom in Etowah County, Ala. At that time, Moore was an assistant district attorney. Corfman s mother went inside for a child custody hearing after Moore offered to watch her daughter. He said,  Oh, you don t want her to go in there and hear all that. I ll stay out here with her,    says Corfman s mother, Nancy Wells, 71.  I thought, how nice for him to want to take care of my little girl. Once he was alone with Corfman, Moore asked for her phone number. It was days later that he picked her up around the corner from her house, drove her about 30 minutes to his home in the woods, then flattered her by telling her how pretty she was and kissed her. But by the second visit, things turned even worse when he took off the 14-year-old s shirt and pants and removed his clothes. Moore then allegedly touched her over her bra and underpants and guided her hand to touch him over his underwear, according to the paper. I wanted it over with   I wanted out,  she recalled thinking at the time.  Please just get this over with. Whatever this is, just get it over. Two of Corfman s childhood friends explained that she told them that she was seeing an older man, and one said that Corfman identified the man as Roy Moore.Corfman s mother said that her daughter told her about the encounter more than a decade later, during the time that Moore was becoming more prominent as a local judge.The Post spoke with three other women who said that Moore pursued them when they were between the ages of 16 and 18 and he was in his early 30s. All three of the women the paper spoke to said that they never had any sexual contact with Moore outside of kissing. According to one woman who was 18-years-old and in high school at the time, Moore would bring bottles of wine to their dates, even though the legal drinking age was 19.One woman, Wendy Miller, said that she first met Moore when she was a 14-year-old working as  Santa s helper  at a mall. He began asking her out when she was 16 years old.But, conservatives will overlook Moore trying to diddle children.This is such a sad, punk move from Breitbart, and people are going to remember it. pic.twitter.com/V8tndfAeCD  Dave Weigel (@daveweigel) November 9, 2017Conservatives voted an admitted sexual predator into the highest office in the land, so Moore might get more votes following this explosive report.

109,"Maybe  thoughts and prayers  aren t the remedy following a shooting, after all. At the First United Methodist Church in East Tennessee, about 20 senior citizens gathered around for a holiday meal. After the meal, the group of elderly churchgoers decided to discuss gun safety. There has, after all, been a spate of mass shootings recently   as many as 317 so far this year. They got the idea for the conversation reportedly after a nearby county s sheriff s department held similar seminars at its local churches, according to Tellico Plains Police Chief Russ Parks. Well, I ve got my gun on me,  an 81-year-old member of the church in Tellico Plains said, according to Parks,  The Washington Post reports. The man then pulled out his holster in which he had a .38-caliber Ruger handgun. He promptly removed the magazine for everyone to see, then cleared the chamber and showed the gun to his fellow parishioners.The churchgoers discussed how to safely bring guns to church, then spoke of the deaths with recent mass shootings, like, for example, the recent Texas massacre in which a gunman shot 26 people dead as they sat in church.The 81-year-old man put the magazine back into the gun and put the gun back in the holster, Parks explained, but then later, while parishioners were cleaning up, one church member who had missed the demonstration asked the man to see the firearm   and that s when everything turned chaotic inside the church.The 81-year-old accidentally pulled the trigger without realizing the gun was loaded, then a bullet fired across the palm of the man s hand and toward his 80-year-old wife, who was sitting in a wheelchair next to him, entering her lower left abdomen, then it went out of the right side of her abdomen, into her right forearm and out the backside of her forearm. Following that, the bullet then ricocheted off the wall and landed under his wife s wheelchair, Parks said.That prompted panic in the church because some of the folks thought an active gunman was on the premises. They had their backs to it,  Parks said.  Somebody hollers,  He s been shot! She s been shot! Call 911! Due to a lot of panic during the calls to 911, the dispatcher assumed someone had entered the church and was shooting, so several schools were put on lockdown.The injured husband and wife were flown to the University of Tennessee Medical Center where they are listed critical condition.We re waiting for the NRA to say,  If only the wife had a gun, she could have protected herself.

Watch: Amazingly, by late last night and early this morning, police Chief David Brown reported that at least 3 of suspected snipers were already in custody.Brown stated early on that he believed the four suspects were working as a unit, using long-range rifles,  triangulated at elevated positions at difference places in the downtown area. The fourth suspect, Micah Xavier Johnson (the media referred to him as  Micah X  to intentionally prompt a Malcolm X tone to the event), we are told was a  military-trained  US Army veteran, who was said to be caught in a shoot-out with police from the second floor of the El Centro parking garage. He was upset about Black Lives Matter, the recent police shootings, he was upset at white people. He wanted to kill white people, especially police officers,  Brown said. (NY Post)  Bizarrely, according to police, Johnson (photo, above) was finally summarily executed by police after an unprecedented  risk assessment  by the Dallas police   who deployed a  robot carrying a bomb.  Chief Brown claimed that his officers  had no choice  but to use the bomb to kill the suspect:  Other options would have exposed our officers to grave danger. The political ripple effects of this unlikely and highly improbable event were felt immediately, as the mainstream media siege was underway, and the politicians began lining up to weigh-in and jockey for political position on any number of issue ranging from gun control, to race relations, and police brutality, but also debating the whether or not public marches and demonstrations are indeed  safe for the public  to attend in the face of this latest  security threat. On the police side of this dialectic, law enforcement are also queuing up to decry the violence against police and calls are omnipresent for increased police powers and security measure in order to  combat the rising threat of domestic extremism. Coincidentally, yesterday s event just happened to all on July 7th, or  7/7  ala London 7/7.  Following on that theme, the media and law enforcement began floating the term  terrorist attack  and CNN leading the pack by claiming that Dallas 7/7 was the police s  worst loss since  9/11  (Sept 11, 2001). So one can see how the spin is already being applied to this media event.The Maidan MassacreBack February 2014, events transpired in Kiev, Ukraine which sparked international outrage and calls for  regime change  in Kiev, and served as the key catalyst for a coup d etat and the ouster of Ukraine s democratically elected president Viktor Yanukovych.  A leaked phone call between EU foreign affairs chief Catherine Ashton and Estonian foreign affairs minister showed how there was knowledge at the highest levels of European government, but western leaders opted to maintain a disinterested stance in the face of this new evidence. Listen to the phone call here: Earlier this year, in January 2016, one such academic investigation concluded that the sniper event at Maidan Square was in fact a  false flag  event which was used to create a false public perception of events and usher in a shift in political power in that country. Canadian political science professor Dr. Ivan Katchanovski of Ottawa University concluded that This academic investigation concludes that the massacre was a false flag operation, which was rationally planned and carried out with a goal of the overthrow of the government and seizure of power,  wrote Katchanovski in his study, called  The  Snipers  Massacre  on the Maidan in Ukraine. Despite all these revelations, the US, UK and the EU are still standing by their earlier narrative of the sniper massacre as a,   Euromaidan democratic, peaceful mass-protest movement and a  color  revolution led by pro-Western parties. Ukraine s own internal investigation into the matter has been shown to be a highly political exercise, which appears to have resulted in a comprehensive cover-up of what really happened on the day.Snipers in Homs, SyriaIn the early days of what western governments and media were portraying as an  Arab Spring  color uprising in Syria in 2010 and 2011, unknown snipers played a crucial role in advancing a  strategy of tension  and fomenting civil unrest, particularly in the city of Homs. Snipers were reported as firing on citizens and also shooting at police indiscriminately. The western media s policy was not to report on this, but only to report on the state security reaction and crack-down triggered by these mysterious and seemingly random acts of violence.Some independent writers and researchers have reported on the anomalies of the Homs shootings, but as yet, no in-depth investigation has taken place.However, the testimony of Father Frans Van der Lugt in Homs, provided a look into what was happening during this ugly phase of a western and GCC-backed rebellion being waged in Syria: From the start, the protest movements were not purely peaceful. From the start I saw armed demonstrators marching along in the protests, who began to shoot at the police first. Very often the violence of the security forces has been a reaction to the brutal violence of the armed rebels. It s clear now after looking back at numerous reports about these incidents, that they were designed to instigate a crisis, which would ultimately lead to either a political instability and civil unrest.The other aspect of these false flag  events, is that they have the potential to also redefine the relationship between the public and the state and its security apparatus.In each instance, a  regime change  was expected, although this was not completely successful in the case of Syria.The Dallas DeceptionThe Dallas Shooting is significant on a number of levels.Firstly, Dallas will further accentuate the artificial divide between what Americans perceive as the  Left  or liberal wing of political society, and the what is sold as America s  Right  or conservative wing. In this dialectic, Democrat is set against Republican, young against old, black is pitted against white, wealthy against poor, upper class against middle class, and even middle class against lower class. In the run-up to the Presidential election in November, this division will be important in order to polarize America along a prefabricated dialectical line and thus keeping the national discourse down at a base, or emotional level   and through this binary process avoid any real examination of America s fundamental issues, policy flaws and the federal government s unsustainable bloated borrow & spend habit   effectively kicking the can down the road another 4 years (which seems to be the norm). Ultimately, this serves the state, its bureaucratic stakeholders and the power structure as a whole. Secondly, this event can be used to nudge the  left-wing  and Democrat party s own gun control agenda, which is being aggressively pursued at the moment. This wing of the political establishment has already demonstrated that it has no qualms about using a national incident or tragedy, like the Orlando Shooting, as warm PR leverage to push their  emergency  legislative agenda. Ironically,  left-wing  and black activists will be blamed for this latest act of political violence and will be used in this case to further advance the political left s own bespoke gun control agenda   much to the dismay of  Conservative America. As a result of this staged event carried out by agent provocateurs,  anti-police  or  anti-government  African-American  militant , or  Black Power  activists will be painted a poor light, and effectively marginalized. Once this process is complete, the state can then move in to extend that marginalization to any  anti-government  protests   further neutering any real grass-roots opposition for what is obviously a rapidly growing police state in the US.Thirdly, this event is being used to increase tension between the public and law enforcement. Note the differences between the short and the long-term narratives at play here. In the short-term, this Dallas Sniper event is originally designed as a  reaction  to US police killing poor unarmed black men on the streets of America, but in the long-term the pendulum will swing back to the state in order to  restore law and order , thus further consolidating power into a more concentrated police state. This is evidenced already by US law enforcement are already rallying in solidarity, in an  us against them  dialectic by placing the nation s police as the protagonist and the public as the antagonist.This obvious dialectical theme is already being echoed internationally on Twitter, as police in the US and the UK advance the term  Thin Blue Line :The Thin Blue Line stretches across the country tonight. We stand by you @DallasPD #Dallas #ThinBlueLine pic.twitter.com/zyiFJWYFDh  NYPD 108th Precinct (@NYPD108Pct) July 8, 2016It should be noted here that the colloquial policing term Thin Blue Line is derived from the term Thin Red Line , which describes as an inferior, outnumbered force holding back the hordes. The original reference of this comes from a Battle of Balaclava   fought by the Highland Infantry Brigade for the British Army during the 19th century Crimean War. Explained: The Thin Red Line has become an English language figure of speech for any thinly spread military unit holding firm against attack. The phrase has also taken on the metaphorical meaning of the barrier which the relatively limited armed forces of a country present to potential attackers.  (Wiki)It s important to understand the symbolism behind this term  Thin Blue Line  which is currently being invoked by law enforcement. It implies an  us against them  dialectical narrative, arguably, quite far and remote from the familiar peace officer-oriented slogan  Protect and Serve.   Finally, this event will be used to reinforce and heighten the ever-increasing profile of America s bizarre new post-9/11 Cult of the First Responder, which appears to be an extension of the  Cult of Our Boys , a lionization campaign which was developed by the Pentagon over years of mass US troop deployment in two highly unpopular wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The main thrust of the effort to glorify and assert to preeminence of the First Responder is part and parcel of a wider US agenda to fully militarize US domestic society, and to characterize US public life as a combat zone, or domestic war zone which society devolves its authority and constant crisis management over to America s new unified command structure and Gendarmerie   the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the FBI.Between the 1960 s and 1990 s, Operation GLADIO saw numerous staged terror events carried out in Europe in order to advance a  strategy of tension . All of the alleged  terrorist  attacks during this time were later proven to be the work not of terrorists, but of the security and intelligence services. Many innocent civilians died, and still to date, no one has been convicted, much less brought before a court or public hearing on a dirty state-sponsored program which many believe is still running to this day, albeit in one form or another.Expect the political rhetoric to spin out of control with each media cycle over the next 72 hours, before fading into Monday. Such is the nature of the Daily Shooter in these troubled and fleetingly real times.Stay tuned here for more stories and updates on the Dallas Deception.READ MORE DALLAS SHOOTING NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Dallas Shooting FilesSupport our work by subscribing and becoming a member @21WIRE.TV",0

295,"Imagine you just heard on the news that  the strongest storm ever observed in the Atlantic  was headed your way, and soon. You would, like anyone concerned for themselves and their family, want to get out as soon as possible. And the quickest way to evacuate from anywhere is the fastest method of travel on earth: Air. But you hit a small snag. You don t have the goddamn fortune that the airlines are now charging for flights that were less than half as much the day before. That has to be against the law, right?Wrong. In Florida, where Hurricane Irma is bearing down like a banshee, there are price-gouging laws like there are in every state. But airlines don t answer to specific states. They re regulated by the FAA and the Department of Transportation, which means no state or local statutes apply to them.So when Lisette Diaz tried to book a flight to get her family out of South Florida, she found that flights from the area   during what is normally a lull in the travel season in Florida   had skyrocketed from a few hundred dollars to over $3,000. Trying to get to New York, she finally settled on tickets out of Fort Lauderdale that cost upwards of $1,300 per traveler. According to the Miami Herald, there were four people traveling with her, including her mother, grandmother, adult cousin, and 11-year-old sister. $6,600 later, she had her tickets.Diaz was far from the only person to run into price gouging. Florida s Attorney General Pam Bondi activated the state s price-gouging hotline for travelers to report these egregious acts.The Herald reported that Antonio Mercurius actually got his tickets from Miami to D.C. on Monday, before the pricing spikes. Out of curiosity, he checked the price of the same ticket the next day and found it had gone up more than 800% per ticket. Said Mercurius,I understand supply and demand but the laws of capitalism should not operate in the times of catastrophic danger. What happens to the people that can t afford flights now?People trying to evacuate responsibly before the storm vented their frustration on Twitter:@AmericanAir really charging $2000 for a flight from Miami to DC. Scum I tell you.  The Last DJ Bender! (@djpushplay21) September 5, 2017Searching for flight tickets for my sister, grandma and cousin and they are over 1k from Miami   New York!  Tu Deseo ?  (@Lissette24twiny) September 5, 2017Totally unacceptable, a $358 flight from Miami to NYC went up to $3578. Why should expect anything decent from these airlines??? F ing RATS! https://t.co/rjdH6J0yOL  Joseph Pep Nodarse (@joerileyhudson) September 6, 2017Looking for flights for the last hour-plus was one of the most stressful experiences I've had in quite a while. Finally got one.  Alex Schwartz (@AlexJSchwartz) September 5, 2017Leave it to the industry that brought you fees for everything from blankets and pillows to a simple name change on a ticket to really kick evacuees while they re down. While we watch storms like Harvey and Irma bring out the best in neighbors and charities, the airline industry quietly profits for our misery.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",0

1224,"What happened to TIME Magazine? The iconic news periodical has reached what may be an all-time low with a cover so bloated with pro-Trump agitprop that it s astonishing it ever made it off of the editor s desk. Yikes.This week, TIME readers will be greeted with a bright red cover with huge letters proclaiming, as Trump has often said, that America is bankrupt and needs pay off its debt or else face doom. To make the connection to Trump even more explicit, the subtitle is: Make America Solvent Again.The problem, as economists were quick to point out, is that almost everything about this cover is meant to terrify the ignorant and obscure the truth. It s fear-mongering plain-and-simple. It plays right into Trump s hands.New TIME cover addresses the national debt. pic.twitter.com/Ty4wyCBbdV  Joe Perticone (@JoePerticone) April 14, 2016For economists, the cover is mind-numbingly stupid. As Mat Yglesias at Vox carefully explained, there are major problems with every facet of the argument. For starters, given how wealth inequality works, averaging the debt across all Americans is a nonsensical way of calculating how debt-ridden the country is. You don t owe $43,000, and companies and billionaires (like Trump) owe even more.Under the circumstances, it s true that dividing up the debt burden evenly among all households would be an enormous burden on many Americans. But there is no reason to divide the burden up this way. The way the federal government finances things is it collects more money from the people who have more money.There s also the fact that this  debt  is often owed to other Americans. The United States borrows from itself a lot giving the illusion of a deep deficit to foreign powers, when really the money is changing hands within the boundaries of the country the whole time. Part of paying off our debt would include cutting a check to ourselves.But perhaps worst of all,  solvency  doesn t mean what TIME wants you to think it means. The American economy is the most powerful in the world (and has grown a lot since the darkest days of the Great Recession), which means paying our debts hasn t been a problem. In fact, the only time creditors began to panic over America s debt was when Republicans in Congress floated the idea of defaulting on them to prove a political point. The antics earned America a drop in its credit rating   not because creditors believed it couldn t pay, but because they worried Republicans simply wouldn t pay.Unfortunately, none of this is made clear by TIME. Instead, people who glance over to a magazine rack in the coming weeks will see the kind of message that Donald Trump has played up: America is broke and pathetic and needs to be made  great  again with his powers of dealmaking. This is simply not true. And on the flip side, many economists have warned that a Trump presidency would hurl the world into crisis, as he has routinely floated the idea of starting trade wars with countries he doesn t like. An event like that really could have the power to destroy America s economy in a way that would be difficult to ever recover from.By enabling a Trump talking point, TIME owes the country an apology. Scare tactics and misleading information are what Trump does best, and he doesn t need any help from a magazine many people trust.Featured image via Twitter",0
1196,"John Podesta is Hillary Clinton s former campaign chairman so you know he s a dirty bird. That s why this is such a fun video to watch. Podesta had a brutal exchange on CBS s  Face the Nation  on Sunday when asked about the campaign s failure to focus on so-called  purple states  in 2016.Host Nancy Cordes noted that an indictment handed down by special counsel Robert Mueller on Friday showed that Russian operatives who meddled in the election appeared to realize the importance of focusing on those battleground contests. Then she goes in for the kill with this question: But it does beg the question, how is it that these Russian operatives knew to focus on purple states like Michigan and Wisconsin and your campaign didn t?  LOL! That s such a great snark-filled question!TRANSCRIPT OF FULL INTERVIEW:NANCY CORDES: Welcome back to  Face the Nation.  I m Nancy Cordes. Our next guest, John Podesta, was the chairman of Hillary Clinton s 2016 campaign. His private emails were hacked and released publicly by Russian-backed entities during the campaign. Mr. Podesta, thank you so much for being with us.JOHN PODESTA: Nice to be back, Nancy.NANCY CORDES: For anyone who voted for Hillary Clinton, these new indictments mean what?JOHN PODESTA: Well, look, it s a tragedy for the American people, really. As Mr. Mueller said in his indictment, this was an act of information warfare against the United States, against our democracy. So I think it s, obviously, disappointing to those of us who were on the receiving end of these Russian active measures, but I think the real victims here are the American people because there, there was direct interference with our democratic institutions.NANCY CORDES: The deputy attorney general was very careful on Friday to say that we don t know whether or not this operation swayed the election. You ve had a lot time think about this, where do you come down on that issue?JOHN PODESTA: Well, look, this was one part of a, of a complex, active interference in the measures. This didn t even deal with the hacking, this was only about what was going on in the social media and the, and the information campaign that was being done there, but there were 80 people, millions of dollars spent. And as one of your previous guests, Senator Coons noted, we won the popular vote by three million votes. They were pushing votes, just to give one example, to Jill Stein. Her vote in Michigan, in Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin was greater than the gap between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in those states. So you can t prove that it did affect the outcome, but it certainly seems likely that it had some impact.NANCY CORDES: But it does beg the question, how is it that these Russian operatives knew to focus on purple states like Michigan and Wisconsin, and your campaign didn t?JOHN PODESTA: Well, of course, we spent a lot of time, energy, and effort in all those states.NANCY CORDES: Hillary Clinton, herself, did not spend much time in those states.JOHN PODESTA: We, you know, we had   Tim Kaine was there, Barack Obama was in   and she spent enormous time in Pennsylvania and Michigan.NANCY CORDES: Sure.JOHN PODESTA: And we spent a lot of effort. We had more staff in Wisconsin than even President Obama had in 2012. But, but I think that begs the question, I think we, we focused on the places we thought were that were you know in contest, and at the end of the day, we fell short in those states. And I think that this active measures effort by the Russians could have tilted the election in, in Donald Trump s favor. But I think what the real issue is, is how he s reacted to that. And in that context, if we re   if this is information warfare, then I think he s the first draft-dodger in the war. I mean, he has done nothing but tried to undermine the Mueller investigation, he hasn t implemented the sanctions that he   was passed by the congress and that he signed in reaction to the, to the activities in the 2016 election. We learned this week, he s ordered no effort to try to get the intelligence community to get together to try to prevent further activities in the 2018 election.NANCY CORDES: Why do you think that is? Do you think it s because to do so would be to admit that somehow the Russians might have influenced this election?JOHN PODESTA: Well, you know, I think that Mr. Trump s psyche is complicated and people have said a lot, a lot about it, but he certainly can t accept that this activity may have helped him, and I think he just constantly tries to move the ball away, including what was, I think, really a despicable tweet about the fact that he s blaming the FBI for investigating the Russia investigation and somehow relating that to the tragic killings in Florida. But you know who knows with Mr. Trump? But he clearly, I think, has failed in carrying out his duty as president of the United States, which is to protect our democracy.NANCY CORDES: Midterm elections are coming up, and it s been reported that Democrats are telling your former boss, Bill Clinton, that in light of the Me Too movement, they, they think he should sit it out, he should be benched, and they re not looking for him to actively campaign for them. Is that true? And do you think that that s the right call?JOHN PODESTA: Look, I think he remains, I think, a figure who is popular with a lot of Democrats across the country. And I think that people are calling him, candidates are calling him and asking for advice. But whether he s going to be an active participant, I think that s not you know really on the top of his mind right now. I think he s doing other things, and, and people make their own judgments about whether he can be helpful in the campaign.NANCY CORDES: Do you think it s a good idea, very quickly, for him to sit it out?JOHN PODESTA: Well, you know, look, I think that, that if I was advising a campaign and a candidate about what to do, I would, I would sort of judge whether he can be helpful. And I think some places he can be, and probably some places he s more of a lightning rod.NANCY CORDES: All right, John Podesta, thank you so much. Campaign chairman for Hillary Clinton. And we ll be right back with our panel of Republicans who are leaving the House and Senate.",0

309,"After more than two years, the Cleveland police officer who fatally shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice has finally been fired. But the reason for his firing has sparked even more outrage.Timothy Loehmann, who was a rookie when he pullled the trigger on that fateful day in November 2014, was not fired for killing an unarmed child. Instead, he was given his walking papers because he lied on his application.Cleveland.com reports:  Loehmann was fired not for shooting Tamir, but for lying on his application with the Cleveland police department. He was also in his probationary period as a Cleveland officer giving the department more flexibility in letting him go, Cleveland Public Safety Director Michael McGrath said. The disciplinary letter cites a letter in Loehmann s personnel file from Independence that says he was emotionally immature and had  an inability to emotionally function.  The letter also cites an emotional breakdown Loehmann had on the gun range in Independence.Cleveland officials said in the letter that Loehmann was supposed to disclose that information. He was also supposed to say in his application that he failed a 2009 written exam when applying to work as an officer in Maple Heights. Loehmann never mentioned the Maple Heights test.A spokesperson for Tamir s relatives said that Loehmann s firing was  deeply disappointing  and only added insult to the pain and grief of the Rice family. Loehmann has been fired because he should never have been a police officer in the first place   but he should have been fired for shooting my son in less than one second, not just for lying on his application,  Tamir s mother, Samaria Rice, said in a statement.On November 22, 2014, police got a report of a black male with a gun in a local park. The 911 dispatcher didn t bother to mention to police that the caller has said it was most likely a child and the gun was probably a fake. When Loehmann arrived with his partner, Frank Garmback, it took about three seconds for Loehmann to shoot and kill the 12-year-old, who was holding a toy gun.An Ohio grand jury decided not to incict either of the officers in December of 2015. Garmback was given a 10-day suspension because he pulled his cruiser too close to the child on the day of the shooting, which violated safety protocol. The 911 operator received an eight day suspension in March of this year for her role Rice s death. The city of Cleveland reached a $6 million settlement with the Rice family in April of last year, but still refused to admit to any wrongdoing.Featured image via Addciting Info Archives",0
465,"The way in which Donald Trump has handled the aftermath of Hurricane Maria s impact on Puerto Rico, an unincorporated territory of the United States, has been nothing short of terrible and incompetent, leading many to question his ability to even locate Puerto Rico on a map. The only thing more disgusting than the actions of President Trump is the behavior of his blind followers and Fox News reporter and former talk show host Geraldo Rivera set the bar relatively low recently.San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul n Cruz reached out to Trump first by pleading in an interview for him to  save us from dying,  but to no avail. Cruz then tried in the only way proven effective, by taking to Twitter almost a week after Hurricane Maria, the strongest hurricane to make landfall in Puerto Rico since 1928, struck the country and left most of the population without power or fresh water. She began by retweeting the pleas of others and then attempted to get Trump s attention directly:Se or Presidente no eliminar las leyes de cabotaje es inmoral. Es un acto de opresi n financiera que solo lograr  agravar nuestra crisis. pic.twitter.com/6UujyEUlTD  Carmen Yul n Cruz (@CarmenYulinCruz) September 28, 2017Her first tweet to Trump was a plea to eliminate the Jones Act, an outdated and antiquated maritime law requiring all goods transported by water between US ports be carried on US-flag ships, constructed in the United States, owned by US citizens, and crewed by US citizens and US permanent residents, a law that is drastically holding up relief efforts. Cruz s tweet read in Spanish,  Mr. President, not to eliminate the laws of cabotage is immoral. It is an act of financial oppression that will only aggravate our crisis.  It is almost certain that Trump can t read Spanish or comprehend the fact that Cabotage is a real term to refer to coastal navigation and trade, so naturally, he saw this as an insult:The Mayor of San Juan, who was very complimentary only a few days ago, has now been told by the Democrats that you must be nasty to Trump.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2017 Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help. They .  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2017 want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort. 10,000 Federal workers now on Island doing a fantastic job.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2017While Trump put off visiting Puerto Rico for another week, Geraldo Rivera decided to make the trip on behalf of Fox News to see what Cruz was so concerned about. There are all people at all municipalities literally starving, dehydrating,  Cruz told Rivera.  We have had our hospital try to go back to speed but then the electricity goes off and we have to do all the bacteria testing, which takes three to four days. Geraldo wasn t convinced and felt the need to interject. But are people dying?  he interrupted.  I ve been traveling around, I don t see people dying. I spoke to the doctors, they say they saw 53 patients and they had a person who was septic, but nobody dying. Mayor Cruz tried her best to reason with the mustachioed one. Dying is a continuum,  she explained.  If you don t get fed for seven, eight days and you re a child, you are dying. If you have 11 people   like we took out of a nursing home   severely dehydrated, you are dying. Watch the madness unfold below and, in case you were wondering, the death toll in Puerto Rico due to Hurricane Maria stood at 16 as of Sunday with only nine hospitals connected to the electric grid.Featured image via screenshot",0
451,"Patrick Henningsen and Shawn Helton 21st Century WireOnce again, we ve arrived at our New Years Eve wrap-up of some of the most compelling and conspiratorial stories of the year. Like in years past, 2017 presented a polarizing political landscape, further exposing the current establishment paradigm. Unlike the establishment gatekeepers, when we use the word  conspiracy  here, we are talking about a real crime scene. Whether it was the ousting of thousands of western-backed terrorists in Iraq and Syria or a string of  known wolf  attacks amplified by made-to-order media agitprop, or the heavily manufactured Russia-gate narrative relentlessly pushed by mainstream outlets and Deep State actors    it seemed there was no shortage of topsy-turvy stagecraft designed to mislead and confuse the masses at a time when the real world is undergoing some significant geopolitical realignments.As was the case in 2016, there were many high-profile incidents and individual stories which didn t make our annual compendium (but they are worth mentioning)   like the  red herring  laced New Year s Eve mass shooting at Turkey s Reina nightclub that kicked off 2017 in classic Daily Shooter fashion, along with other dubious events like Fort Lauderdale s FBI-known shooter and subsequent CNN media circus. On the political front, it was a banner year for astroturfing starting with  The Resistance  which spent most of the first 3 months of the year demanding Trump s impeachment before he had served 100 days in office. As part of these efforts, we saw Hollywood and the Democratic Party s choreographed women s march backed by political agitator and perennial globalist George Soros, as well as MoveOn.org and other Soros-backed protests which followed Trump s highly controversial immigration ban, as contentious resignations by key members of the Trump White House loomed large. The stage was then set for Antifa s US  riot tour  which culminated the Charlottesville riots in Virginia followed by a series of  social justice  protests over Confederate statues, followed by more extremist left-wing  antifascists  foot-soldiers like  black bloc  throwing molotov cocktails and smashing buildings for kicks. And that only scratches the surface of what transpired in 2017.Other notable stories throughout the year included the Trump administration s decision to announce the creation of an  Arab NATO headquartered in Saudi Arabia, the world s second-largest state sponsored of terror (US being the largest).  That geopolitical gambit then teed up the Trump White House to announce that the US Embassy in Tel Aviv would begin proceedings to move to Jerusalem, a shift which some critics believe is further evidence of an ultra-Zionist agenda encroaching on Israeli-occupied Palestine and the West Bank. On the Asia front, questions emerged over what North Korea actually has in terms of ICBM missiles and a nuclear deterrent, while in the Middle East speculation raged about Saudi Arabia s historic palace purge and sabre rattling in the region. The year then saw the exposure of a giant US-NATO-Saudi weapons trafficking operation using diplomatic flight in order to arm terrorists in Syria and Iraq. 2017 also saw the mainstream media continue to market the media construct known as Bana of Aleppo, expecting the public to believe that an 8 year old girl who could not speak English was running a Twitter account from war-torn (and terrorist-occupied) East Aleppo from the autumn of 2016   all the while waxing poetic about the evil Assad, and the evil Russians and calling for US military intervention in Syria  pure propaganda and a clear case of child exploitation. Interestingly, this outlandish Bana propaganda myth campaign has been shamelessly promoted by the multimillionaire Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling. 2017 also saw a wave of intelligence releases, set in motion by the CIA, who released more than 12 million documents pertaining to covert war programs, psychic research and the Cold War era, further outlining the symbiotic relationship between the agency and American media. This was followed by Wikileaks exposing much of the CIA s cyber hacking capabilities in their  Vault 7  and later in their  Vault 8  publications. Towards the end of the year, a new twist in the downing of MH17 revealed an apparent Netherlands cover-up, as another bizarre Daily Shooter event, the Texas Church shooting, would later disappear from headlines. Around the same time frame, new questions also emerged in the Sandy Hook saga concerning prior knowledge of the FBI, as New York was then stricken by a known wolf truck attacker. In December it was finally announced that after being held in prison for two years without trial, the Fed s Bundy Ranch Standoff case was declared a mistrial. However, most of the year s controversial stories were quickly pushed to the back page, buried underneath an avalanche of ready-to-go Weinstein-inspired sex abuse scandals involving Hollywood s elite punctuated by obligatory hashtag campaigns like #MeToo, before snagging a number of high-profile news media personalities and some of Washington s most coveted swamp dwellers. As an onslaught of new accusations flooded the media, the sordid revelation of a Congressional slush fund used to payoff sexual harassment accusers made headlines. The whole situation conjured DC s Conspiracy of Silence regarding tales of sexual misconduct in days past.All in all, it was another year of  hyper-real  media propaganda, as some stories published by mainstream media led to a cascade of retractions and corrections, and in certain cases, provided an all to convenient mask for other politically charged news throughout much of 2017. Unlike the mainstream media  official  conspiracies (like Russiagate), these ones are actually real  10.  The JFK Files  Over the course of 2017, one of America s most compelling conspiracies was reignited following the release of thousands of intelligence files long-held by the CIA and FBI. In late October, the Trump administration called for the release of the remaining JFK files, citing the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act deadline placed into law in 1992. While the material released was reportedly a mix of new and old, some critics declared that the recently declassified files revealed even more startling evidence related to the assassination of the 35th President of the United States, John F. Kennedy. This prompted larger legacy media establishments to provide a murky retelling of the JFK saga.  Predictably, a week after the releases, one newer CIA memo stated that any links between the CIA and Lee Harvey Oswald, were  unfounded.  In essence, the JFK file releases appear to have been a way for the political powers that be to shut the door on a conspiracy that has an overwhelming amount of information suggesting CIA links not only to Oswald, but many of the characters surrounding the case. In reality though, as newfound interest in the JFK files was reawakened, it cast light on the over five decade old case, reopening the door to coup d tat claims concerning JFK and Cold War era  false flag  terror. In particular, terror created by Operation GLADIO, a CIA-NATO construct, which utilized covert armies to subvert the political interests of various nations through the implementation of a Cold-War era strategy of tension. The further one digs into America s seedy underworld of organized crime, intelligence operations, unlikely coincidences and secretive relationships concerning the mysterious plot to kill Kennedy, a highly intricate web of activity emerges that points to a compelling case beyond almost any other modern-day conspiracy.9. Grenfell Tower Fire & Cover-Up   It was Britain s biggest domestic disaster post WWII, and from the minute this story broke, reports of government and corporate corruption began to surface. This real-life Towering Inferno featured some of the most surreal revelations, including a corrupt government Qango known as TMO (Tenant Management Organisation) who had paid a contractor to install highly flammable petroleum-based  cladding  on the building, supposedly to meet  green sustainability goals  but also to cover-up what wealthy property developers deemed as an eye sore (social housing high rise building), part of London s continuous and rampant  gentrification  property bubble agenda. The controversy did not stop with the fire itself though, as residents and concerned members of the public began to question the abnormally low death count which was being trumpeted by the media and the government agencies. Meanwhile, thousands of residents from Grenfell Tower and the surrounding buildings continued to suffer and mourn the loss of loved ones and friends   leaving in indellible scar on the community   while the government s elite Common Purpose management class continued on with business as usual. Six months on,  the public is still wondering whether anyone will be arrested, or held to account for this unprecedented story of criminal negligence. In one of its most seminal episodes, the SUNDAY WIRE radio show, along with its affiliate the UK Column, drove the investigative agenda early on in this story, with the mainstream media later picking talking points covered by this independent media outlet.8. The Crisis in Yemen   Back in January 2015   while the world was focused on the war in Syria, 21WIRE first raised the alarm over Yemen after it noticed the insatiable war-time president Barack Obama, along with Deep State and Pentagon media outlet CNN began drifting out talking points about Yemen. It wasn t long after that, in March 2015, that Saudi Arabia   with the full military and political backing of the US and UK, began an undeclared war of aggression against Saudi s neighbor Yemen. Nearly three years on, with tens of thousands slaughtered by Saudi airstrikes dropping their newly purchased US and UK munitions (and even enjoying air refueling by the US military) and with the Saudi and US military blockade which is keeping much-needed humanitarian aid from entering the war-ravaged country leading to mass starvation and disease outbreaks like cholera on the peninsula   why isn t the international community calling out the illegal war against Yemen for what it is   genocide? In order to prop-up their fake narrative on Yemen, the US and UK mainstream media conglomerates and their state propaganda directors from intelligence agency information warfare units have concocted a new batch of official disinformation lies and myths used to muddy the waters of this important discussion and ultimately justify their slaughter and arms sales bonanza in Yemen. On balance, what the US, UK and Saudi Arabia have done to Yemen is by orders of magnitude worse than what Nazi Germany did to its neighbors in the initial phase of WWII. Nothing less than a new Nuremberg Trial will be suitable to help correct this act of international barbarism.7. London s GLADIO-style Attacks  On March 22nd, an apparent two-pronged terror attack stretched from London s Westminster Bridge to Parliament Square. In the days leading up to the London attacks, it was revealed that Met Police rehearsed a  terrifyingly realistic drill on the River Thames prior to yet another known wolf act of terror taking place. Adding to the drama, the London attacks occurred exactly one year after the Brussels airport bombings. In addition, the bizarre and unexpected event took place during a massive uptick of Western allied involvement in the Syrian conflict and in less than 24 hours, London authorities revealed that the British-born attacker named Khalid Masood, (after media outlets erroneously reported the wrong suspect) was already well-known to MI5 and had worked in Saudi Arabia sometime between 2005-2008. Shortly after the attack, it was revealed that eye-witnesses reported seeing multiple assailants at the crime scene, this was something that directly contradicted the official story. In fact, in those reports, it was suggested that at least two individuals participated in the large-scale attack in one of the most heavily surveilled parts of London. This aspect of the case was quickly buried by major media outlets, echoing other high-profile cases involving  known wolf  terrorists. In recent years, there s been a pattern of multiple suspects often witnessed or said to be involved in other terror-related events. This proved to be the case in the aftermath of the Nice, France truck attack, as well as the Brussels airport bombing in 2016. Rather incredibly or unbelievably, London s acting Police Commissioner Craig Mackey, just so happened to be at the scene to  witness  the Parliament Square attack on Pc Keith Palmer. All in all, the latest symbolically charged  ISIS-approved  attack on the verge of spring, appeared to be an effort to polarize the perception of Western viewers with yet another round of wartime propaganda, while also providing a media smoke screen for recent US military action in Syria. By early summer, just after the Manchester arena bombing, London once again became a target of a purported multi-pronged terror event right on the heels of the UK s hotly contested 2017 general election. Afterwards, a number of questions were raised following the London Bridge attacks, just as there were following the Parliament Square, Westminster Bridge attacks and the Manchester Arena attack. It s important to note the common thread between each suspicious event, and the recent UK attacks are no exception   there s now indisputable evidence linking MI5 and MI6 British security services to various  known wolves  prior to carrying out the terror crimes mentioned above. The precarious relationship between security and terror is an ongoing pattern seen after almost every major terror attack on Western soil. Throughout 2017, the London attacks seemed to increase racial and ethnic tensions in the West, while also pushing the public into accepting a more direct military intervention in Syria, and new police state measures and surveillance powers in the UK   prompting us to ask, who benefited the most from the London Attacks? We d say the answer to that question is pretty obvious now 6. Manchester s  Known Wolf  Arena Attack  Another day, another conspiratorial crime. In this case, the public was witness to yet another known wolf  terror attack allegedly carried out by an  ISIS-inspired  individual who, as with numerous other cases, was under the gaze of MI5. The man named in the Manchester bombing attack, Salman Abedi, was also tied to a terror group supported by NATO in Libya during the operation to oust Muammar el-Qaddafi in 2011. The Manchester arena attack proved to be more than just blowback from security operations gone awry, it provided further evidence of complicity on behalf of the West in the  War On Terror  era. While some researchers and analysts were a buzz with the numerological synchronicities associated with the Manchester attack, others noted some very real political circumstances and significant timelines surrounding this apparent mass-tragedy in Manchester. The event just happened to arrive on the heels of a monolithic arms deals with Saudi Arabia worth $110 billion dollars that will total $350 billion over the next 10 years, and only shortly after the Manchester attack, there were US-led coalition airstrikes supposedly targeting ISIS in both Syria and Iraq   that killed 121 civilians in the process. The strikes led to increased tension, placing external pressure on the Russian-led Astana Peace Agreement in Syria, while continuing to benefit the strategic movements of ISIS in Syria. The really damning link however, was exposed by one major UK Government eyesore after the Manchester attacks: the revelation that a community of  outlawed  Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) terrorists were in fact living in close proximity to the Manchester attacker Abedi, and directly connected to Abedi himself. This was a deeply troubling development for a public unaware of the nearby danger, as British security services and officials allowed this  thriving  group of fighters to reside in the UK seemingly without consequence or disclosure of their previous activities   until the Manchester attack. So naturally, when it was revealed that Ramadan Abedi (the father of the purported Manchester suicide bomber) was also a member of the UK government-backed Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) and was believed to have been a part of LIFG during the NATO-backed regime change operation in Libya in 2011   it only raised more questions concerning the attack. It s worth noting, Libya s militant governor of Tripoli, Abdel Hakim Belhadj, was also a part of the Mujahideen fighters closely linked to Bin Laden who became known as al-Qaeda. In fact, Belhadj returned to his home country [in 1995] as head of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, an underground paramilitary organisation dedicated to Gaddafi s downfall. Over the years, Belhadj was incarcerated and turned loose back into the field after being rendered by the CIA and British security services. As of 2015, despite the Manchester attack links to LIFG, the group is still on the US State Department s Delisted Foreign Terrorist Organizations. In the days after the attack, authorities released CCTV imagery apparently depicting the Manchester attacker Abedi, in what appeared to be a way to dramatize the bombing through emotionally charged imagery, as the media obscured other facts and connections observed in the aftermath of the attack itself. The Manchester attack was similar to other high-profile incidents used to distort public opinion in the wake of media styled mass-tragedies.5.  The Las Vegas Mass Shooting   October 1st marked the return of the Great American Mass Shooting   a real record-breaker, complete with a shocking mile-long crime scene that stretched from the Las Vegas Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino to the nearby Route 91 Festival, where thousands of concertgoers suddenly became a target. Although America had seen a host of smaller, less sensationalized mass shootings throughout the course of 2017, including the bizarre Fort Lauderdale Airport Shooting and the strange Programmed to Kill Texas Church shooting, the high-profile Las Vegas calamity resuscitated the trauma inducing imagery so prevalent in the post-9/11 War On Terror era. This made-for-TV event was designed for media shock and awe, like  the 9/11 of Mass Shootings.  Over the past several years, 21WIRE has chronicled many bizarre shootings and mass casualty incidents that have rippled across America and Europe. These events have become a new kind of ritualized  crimescape  moving well beyond  security  concerns, but now accompanied by a complete range of  socio-political mainstream media talking points including race, religion,  gun reform ,  social media concerns  and domestic extremism   while concurrently obscuring and obfuscating the forensic reality of the crimes themselves. We re told that this tragic shooting attack was carried out by a classic  lone gunman    one individual without a criminal past (or nay past, as far as we could tell)  but there proved to be much more to the story. Adding to this  hyper-real  incident, the main suspect in the Las Vegas tragedy was also revealed to be a multi-millionaire  players club  member, 64 year-old Stephen Paddock. With no motive and no criminal history, Las Vegas police were tasked with uncovering details of a crime overseen by billionaire bosses at MGM Resorts International and the FBI. As authorities failed to uncover a clear motive for the crime, police scanner audio, along with eye-witness testimony suggested that multiple shooters may have been at the scene, although this aspect was downplayed by mainstream media. This was quickly followed by several official  revisions  in the timeline of the shooting and even the crime scene itself, as evidenced by this disastrous press conference which failed to yield any new information in the case. The star-witness of the shooting, Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Campos, also vanished and was declared  missing  right before a major media interview, only to resurface much later on the oddest of media venues,  The Ellen DeGeneres Show,  giving media gatekeepers the chance to run interference for DeGeneres s slot machine business partners at MGM. Along the way, bizarre media performances by Paddock s brother, Eric Paddock, only prompted more questions and deepened the mystery surrounding this surreal case. While the public waited for MGM to release CCTV footage of the alleged shooter Paddock, not one tape materialized, except for an older tape from 2011. Staged photos of the Mandalay Bay crime scene led to other forensic questions concerning the weaponry used, compounding other acoustic anomalies already noted. Other confusing elements of the case included the missing hard drive from Paddock s laptop, another brother s arrest, the wiring of $100,000 to his live-in girlfriend s (Marilou Danley) home country, the Philippines, Paddock s previous employment at the predecessor company of Lockheed Martin, a reported break-in at one of his homes after the shooting, the absurd insertion of an  ISIS-inspired  motive (which a number of dubious click-bait media outlets ran with), and later seeing a back drop of active shooter related drills and government activity, along with details suggesting Paddock may not have been alone and much more. In the search for answers in America s largest-ever mass shooting, months later, we still have yet to see any CCTV footage of the alleged killer or his whereabouts leading up to the tragedy, as he moved in and around Las Vegas. Imagine that: no CCTV footage. While some have attempted to make sense of the Las Vegas shooting tragedy, there are reports of a major push to revamp security in the hospitality industry through the use of gunfire detection systems, X-ray, body scanners and facial recognition in the wake of this confusing, if not partly manufactured event. The popular media concept of a lone wolf killer in today s world has reprogrammed the public mind in the very same way that the serial killer phenomenon did decades ago. This new fear-based saga has ushered in a string of improbable Hollywood-style scenarios, inducing a frozen apathy across the masses. Rather than looking deeply at crime scene forensics or pouring over piles of collected data, these Daily Shooter crimes hold the public psyche hostage  until the next unexplained mass tragedy. Until the next episode 4. Syria s Sarin Gas False Flag  In less than 24 hours after the highly dubious alleged chemical attack on April 4th (reported to be Sarin gas by Western media) in Khan Shaykhun in the Idlib province of Syria, wide-scale unsubstantiated condemnation laid blame at the doorstep of the Syrian government and Russia following the release of video footage that had yet to be forensically scrutinized. In fact, the mainstream media flooded the airwaves with a bevy of circumstantial and speculative evidence   a far cry from actual hard evidence. Leaders in Washington and Western media outlets once again set the stage for wider military intervention in Syria. Days after the release of a forensically unproven chemical attack out of Khan Shaykhun, US President Donald Trump ordered a military strike on the Syrian government s Shayrat Air Base in response to the alleged chemical attack in Idlib. Trump s missile strike won him instant praise from the Pentagon media oracle CNN, as well as giddy celebrations by war-mongering neocons in the US. Perhaps the most telling aspect of  Syria s most recent mass casualty terror tragedy, was the suspicious involvement of the US-UK-NATO-Gulf state backed NGO known as the White Helmets  a group who once again was witnessed in wartime imagery that was not only full of anomalies but a production designed to evoke an emotional response rather than one based in rationality. Since their inception in late 2013, the White Helmets have largely conducted their so-called rescue operations in rebel-terrorist held areas in Syria, while producing an unprecedented amount of western-oriented war propaganda for nations deeply invested in arming and backing rebel-terrorists vying for regime change in Syria. Nearly two weeks after the alleged sarin gas attack, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Professor Theodore Postol directly disputed claims concerning the official US report regarding the alleged chemical weapons attack out of Khan Shaykhun in the  rebel-held  terrorist-occupied Idlib province of Syria. Postol s initial analysis, along with its addendum, appeared to echo what MIT research affiliate and former US Congressional staffer Subrata Ghoshroy observed in the aftermath of the Syrian chemical incident in East Ghouta, Damascus in 2013. In addition, other award-winning American journalists like Seymour Hersh and Gareth Porter also exposed the  sarin attack  narrative as a fabrication promulgated by a corrupt OPCW   but their reports were muted by mainstream gatekeepers. Both apparent attacks in Damascus and Idlib, were claimed through the presentation of dubious video imagery and suspicious photographs as a main source of evidence. Despite the absence of any real forensic investigation, the western media proclaimed  certainty  over images and videos largely supplied by the dubious  NGO  known as the  White Helmets.  It would later be revealed that on April 4th, the Syrian Air Force had also struck a warehouse in Idlib where chemical weapons were said to have been produced and stockpiled by US-backed militants. What was most disturbing, was that many in US-UK leadership seemed desperate for the public to buy into any WMD claims without concrete proof and in the process, they deliberately pushed heavily propagandized imagery presented on social media as proof of the as yet forensically unproven sarin gas attack. In essence, the whole event became a wag the dog moment ensnaring not only the White House, but many leaders in the UK as well.3. White Helmets Fraud   The White Helmets. Who are they, who created them, who funds them, and which master do they serve in Syria? In the US and in Europe, these fundamental questions routinely go unanswered by the western mainstream media organizations and government officials. Since first appearing on the western media scene in late 2013, the UK and US government-funded pseudo  NGO  known as the White Helmets has achieved cult-like status as their pictures adorn the front pages of newspapers and CNN breaking news segments about Syria. For the last 4 years, their principle function has been to produce a steady stream of  anti-Assad regime  and anti-Russian propaganda tailored for western audiences. Since 2015, 21WIRE led the way in asking these important questions, and in 2017 the overwhelming pressure of mounting evidence of the White Helmet fraud eventually led to various shoddy academics in the US and in the UK mainstream media outlets attacking 21WIRE and its writers for challenging the official White Helmets narrative   and for exposign how the UK government has been channeling hundreds of millions of pounds into terrorist-occupied areas of Syria under the thin guise building  civil society  (US and UK trojan horse) organizations in Syria. Establishment attacks included one mainstream media outlet promoting the White Helmets, The Guardian newspaper in the UK. According to The Guardian anyone who dared to question their official government-sanctioned narrative were  conspiracy theorists  and somehow part of a secret  Russian-backed propaganda campaign.  Despite mountains of evidence including various fake rescue videos, colluding in acts of murder and extreme violence and evidence which clearly depicts the dodgy  search and rescue  groups  members as dual members in armed al Qaeda terrorist affiliates operating in  rebel-held  opposition areas of Syria   western mainstream media are still determined to play dumb on this issue, which only goes to prove just how ignorant mainstream gatekeepers are as to the realities on the ground in Syria, or worse   how controlled are mainstream editors  desks by the western intelligence apparatus. Either way, Toto has already drawn the Wizard s curtain all the way back   and it s only a question of time before western media apologists and clueless politicians retreat into full  no comment  mode on this issue.2. The Russia-Gate PsyOp   It s been 18 months since the Democratic Party and the US mainstream media launched its  Russia-gate  narrative, claiming that Moscow had hacked the DNC, John Podesta and somehow influenced the result of the US 2016 Presidential Election. 18 months later, there s still no evidence to substantiate this mainstream conspiracy theory   making Russiagate easily the biggest fake news story of the year. What s most telling about this  official  conspiracy theory (as it turns out, it s the mainstream that peddles the grandest conspiracy theories) is that its proponents have to resort to publishing repeated lies and wild exaggerations in order to maintain the pillars supporting their narrative. So desperate were the New York Times to tie Trump to Russia that it even claimed that  the Russians  where creating Facebook pages about puppies in order to  confuse and mislead  vulnerable American voters. New York Times also had to retract their central lie which claimed that 17 US Intelligence agencies had all agreed that the Russians meddled in the 2016 presidential election   but still we hear legions of mindless  journalists  and shaky politicians like Adam Schiff (who, not surprisingly is also promoting the White Helmets) repeating that same old canard. As part of Washington s new McCarthyite red scare reboot, the US government labeled Russian international media network RT, and RT America as  foreign agents    forcing the channel and its journalists to register with the US government under old outdated pre-WWII espionage legislation. Other fake claims by US media include  Kremlin bots  deployed on Facebook to mess with the fragile minds of potential voters on social media, and CNN s all-time classic: an  Exclusive!  no less   claiming that the Russians somehow infiltrated the computer game Pokemon Go in order to  sow confusion among Americans.  Honestly, we couldn t make it up if we tried. What s beyond ironic is that the same media who has been constantly crying  fake news!  as their prime talking point to explain how Trump beat Clinton   has been dutifully recycling their own fake news narrative for over a year now. This one will surely go down in history as the biggest political hoax of all-time   and all of the mainstream media outlets who helped promulgate this myth should also go down with it. Sadly, too many mentally-challenged lawmakers in the US, UK and Europe are actually basing their foreign policies of this mainstream fake news myth   which is all too convenient for an ever-inflating the US defense budget, NATO s breakneck expansion eastward, and also for Brussels  new roll-out of its EU Army  1.  Fake News 2.0    2017 was the year of fake news. Last year, we crowned Fake News 1.0 as our top conspiracy, but this past year has seen it ascend to an entirely new level. From the beginning, this faux crisis had a clear set of political objectives. The first was to provide a scapegoat for Hillary Clinton s catastrophic imploding presidential run, and secondly, to try and prop-up the establishment s official conspiracy theory that somehow the Russians were spreading  fake news  across social media and alternative media websites   in order to help Donald Trump win the election. On this front, many of us are indebted to Trump for branding CNN with the meme that keeps sticking, as the President hit CNN s bumbling White House correspondent Jim Acosta, with Trump pointing to Acosta and saying,  You are fake news!  live on national TV. If was a glorious moment for sure. Newspapers like the Washington Post performed a key role for the US Deep State by pushing-out fictional news features like the one claiming 200 of the leading alternative media websites were part of some Kremlin-orchestrated network of websites carrying out  active measures  (a defunct Cold War term) propaganda against the American people. The Post even presented a bogus anonymous construct, a website called  PropOrNot  in order to try and make their conspiracy theory look official. Around the same time, a radical progressive academic from Merrimack College in Massachusetts published a  fake news list    a database and virtual  blacklist  designed to defame and slander any independent medi",0

This is not your mama s lame duck presidency, but a stealth effort to do everything possible to push the agenda at all costs. The big question is that if Obama continues to defy the rule of law like this, shouldn t Congress finally take action against him? Who ll stand up?   I ve got a pen and I ve got a phone. And I can use that pen to sign executive orders and take executive actions    King Obama A newly leaked internal DHS memorandum produced for an off-the-record agency conclave reveals that the Obama administration is actively planning to circumvent a federal court injunction that suspended part of last November s deferral-based amnesty initiative. The document, apparently prepared as follow-up from a DHS  Regulations Retreat  last summer, appears sure to re-ignite concerns in Congress as well as federal judges in the Fifth Circuit. The Administration has already been criticized from the bench for handing out work permits to hundreds of thousands of deferred action beneficiaries, in direct violation of a district court s order. With the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals deciding any day now whether to deny the Administration s request to reverse that injunction, this public leak has come at a critical juncture for U.S. enforcement policy. Last June, four months after Texas federal judge Andrew Hanen s order to freeze President s DAPA and Expanded DACA programs disclosure: the Immigration Reform Law Institute has filed briefs in these cases DHS s immigration policy makers apparently held a  Regulations Retreat  to discuss  different options  for  open market Employment Authorization Document (EAD) regulatory changes.  EAD is the statutory term for work permits. From a memo recording these discussions, we now know that the Obama DHS has, rather than pausing to allow the courts to assess the constitutionality of its enforcement nullification initiatives, been gearing up to roll out one or more of four plans drawn up at the meeting, each one designed to provide EADs to millions of nonimmigrants, including those lawfully present and visa overstayers, crippling the actual employment-based visa system on the federal statute-book.

1105,"Donald Trump s obsession with building a massive expensive wall along the Mexican border is literally going to make America less secure.Despite claiming that he will beat back terrorism and keep Americans safe, Trump is drafting a budget proposal that would cripple three of the nation s most critical agencies that do way more to help Americans than any wall will ever do.The cost of Trump s wall is projected to reach past $20 billion. During the campaign, Trump repeatedly claimed that Mexico would pay for the wall, but it s clear now that American taxpayers will be footing the bill. And rather than create a new budget item, Trump is considering just cutting funding from existing national security and national emergency management agencies to use it to pay for the wall instead.On the chopping block includes the U.S. Coast Guard, a crucial branch of the military that patrols and secures our ports, coast lines, and waterways, defending them from potential terrorist attacks and rescuing people.This particular cut is fiercely opposed by Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter, who explained on CNN Wednesday why the Coast Guard is too important to slash. You have President Trump talking about security, criminal networks   that s what the Coast Guard does, literally!  Hunter said.  So how can the president talk about  stopping illegal immigration, illegal drugs, and criminal narco networks, and then say we re going to cut the military and cut the Coast Guard? The way you stop bad things from happening here is not directly on the border, necessarily. So this is nonsensical to me. But that s not all.According to the Washington Post,The proposal, drawn up by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), also would slash the budget of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which provides disaster relief after hurricanes, tornadoes and other natural disasters. The Coast Guard s $9.1 billion budget in 2017 would be cut 14 percent to about $7.8 billion, while the TSA and FEMA budgets would be reduced about 11 percent each to $4.5 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively.In regards to the Transportation Security Administration, Trump plans to cut post-9/11 programs, which includes a program that trains airline crews how to deal with hijackers, a program that funds the use of special law enforcement teams that sweep transportation hubs for potential threats prior to and during major events like an inauguration, a program that gives local law enforcement more ability to patrol in and around airports, and a program that funds the use of special TSA agents who are trained to specifically detect people exhibiting odd behavior at check-points.In other words, programs that  have been considered a vital piece of airport security and for preventing a repetition of the Sept. 11, 2001, hijackings So Trump is literally looking to sacrifice programs designed to prevent another 9/11 in order to build a wall that most experts consider useless in stopping immigration.Donald Trump is once again demonstrating that he cares more about himself than he does about the safety and security of the American people. The Coast Guard protects our coastal boarders from inside and outside threats. The TSA helps prevent another 9/11 attack from occurring on American soil. And FEMA responds to help Americans before, during, and after a disaster strikes. Gutting these agencies doesn t make America safer. It makes us more vulnerable and that appears to be exactly what Trumps wants.If it wasn t clear enough before, it definitely is now. Trump is the greatest threat to our national security.Featured image via Mark Wallheiser/Getty Images",0
1005,"During testimony in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee on Monday, former acting Attorney General Sally Yates revealed that she warned Trump administration officials three times about former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. The hearing today involved Russia s meddling in the 2016 election so of course, Ted Cruz grilled Yates about her thoughts on Trump s attempt to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. That, of course, makes no sense but Cruz was trying to defend the man who previously insulted his wife s looks during the campaign.Yates was fired as acting AG after refusing to defend Trump s executive order, which she said violated the U.S. Constitution s religious protections.Cruz told Yates that the Office of Legal Counsel had issued a determination that the executive order was legal, but Yates countered that finding by saying it ignored the First Amendment in favor of an obscure statute which had since been updated. In this particular instance, particularly where we were talking about a fundamental issue of religious freedom, not the interpretation of some arcane statute, but religion freedom, it was appropriate for us to look at the intent behind the president s actions and the intent is laid out in his statements,  Yates said.Yates said she did not believe Trump s executive order was  lawful  and used  religious freedom  to defend herself from Cruz s attack on her.When Cruz quoted part of the Constitution, Yates came back at him with a statute which she said  Trumps the first one you described. In the over 200 years of the Department of Justice history, are you aware of any instance in which the Department of Justice has formally approved the legality of a policy and three days later the attorney general has directed the department not to follow that policy and to defy that policy?

This is such a Democrat thing they love to make up a false narrative and push it over and over to the sheeple who follow them. It s really pitiful that after so many months that all the Democrats have is this lie The electoral college is a brilliant creation because it gives balance to voters Would you want California and New York deciding our elections? That s what would happen without the electoral college. We bet that Perez already knows this but is counting on the uneducated voters to buy into it .Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez incorrectly stated  the Electoral College is not a creation of the Constitution  during a Tuesday night speech.(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = 'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.10';  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));DNC Chair Tom Perez incorrectly claims  the Electoral College is not a creation of the Constitution Posted by Fox & Friends on Friday, October 27, 2017 The Electoral College is not a creation of the Constitution,  Perez said during a lecture at Indiana University Law School.  It doesn t have to be there. The Electoral College, a mechanism for indirect election of the president created by the Founding Fathers as a compromise between smaller states and larger states, is clearly laid out in Article II of the Constitution:  Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress. Perez has previously stated that President Donald Trump  didn t win  last November s election because Hillary Clinton won the popular vote:Following his comment, Perez went on to explain his hopes that states agree to a  national popular vote compact,  in which states agree to give their allocated electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote. There s a national popular vote compact in which a number of states have passed a bill that says, we will allocate our vote, our electoral votes, to the person who wins the national popular vote once other states totaling 170 electoral votes do the same,  Perez said.  I m frankly proud to tell you that the first state to pass such a law was Maryland. The main supporters of the plan put forward by Perez seem to understand it is a plan to circumvent the system created by the Constitution, not an argument that the system doesn t exist.The comment from Perez came during a lecture honoring former Indiana Democratic Sen. Birch Bayh, who was accused last year of sexual assault by a writer who said Bayh groped her in the backseat of a limousine. VIA: WFBOUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE:PLEASE SHARE THIS WITH THE CLUELESS LEFT!   If the president were elected by unfiltered national vote, small and rural states would become irrelevant, and campaigns would spend their time in large, populous districts.   The Electoral College remains in place over two centuries after the framers of the Constitution empowered it to select presidents. Though occasionally maligned, this system of electing a chief executive has been incredibly successful for the American people.The Founding Fathers created the Electoral College after much debate and compromise, but it has provided stability to the process of picking presidents. Though the winner of the national popular vote typically takes the presidency, that vote failed to determine the winner in four elections: 1824, 1876, 1888, and 2000.Some see the Electoral College as a peculiar and mystifying institution that ensures only a few, select individuals will ever cast a direct vote for president in the United States. Others complain that the system rewards smaller states with more proportional power than the large ones.Every four years, around election time, there are murmurs about revamping the system and moving toward a direct, national popular vote.The Founders  CollegeAs one of The Heritage Foundations legal experts, Hans von Spakovsky, noted in a paper on the Electoral College:  In creating the basic architecture of the American government, the Founders struggled to satisfy each state s demand for greater representation while attempting to balance popular sovereignty against the risk posed to the minority from majoritarian rule. Some elements of the Electoral College, such as the indirect vote through intermediaries, were hotly debated at the 1787 Constitutional Convention. It was eventually justified in part as a stopgap to potentially reverse the vote if the people elected a criminal, traitor, or similar kind of heinous person. The Founders wanted to empower democratic elements in the American system, but they feared a kind of pure, unrestrained democracy that had brought down great republics of the past.The product of the Founders  compromise has been well balanced and enduring, and we would be wise to leave it intact.Alexander Hamilton defended the Electoral College in Federalist 68. He argued that it was important for the people as a whole to have a great deal of power in choosing their president, but it was also  desirable  that  the immediate election should be made by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station, and acting under circumstances favorable to deliberation, and to a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements which were proper to govern their choice. Hamilton also wrote that this system of intermediaries would produce a greater amount of stability, and that an     intermediate body of electors will be much less apt to convulse the community with any extraordinary or violent movements, than the choice of one who was himself to be the final object of the public wishes. As students of ancient history, the Founders feared the destructive passions of direct democracy, and as recent subjects of an overreaching monarch, they equally feared the rule of an elite unresponsive to the will of the people. The Electoral College was a compromise, neither fully democratic nor aristocratic.The Constitution states:Each state shall appoint, in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct, a number of electors, equal to the whole number of senators and representatives to which the state may be entitled in the Congress.In addition to balancing the protection of individual rights and majority rule, the Founding Fathers attempted to create a  federalist  system that would keep most of policymaking power reserved to states and localities. America s presidential election system also was designed to empower the states, not just the American people as an undifferentiated mass.The total number of electors and thus electoral votes across all states and the District of Columbia included after the passage of the 23rd Amendment adds up to 538. The winner must receive a majority, or 270, of these votes to become president.The system empowers states, especially smaller ones, because it incentivizes presidential candidates to appeal to places that may be far away from population centers. Farmers in Iowa may have very different concerns than bankers in New York. A more federalist system of electing presidents takes that into account.The states are free to select the method in which they choose their electors. In the early days of the republic, most states chose to have their legislatures pick electors, rather than the people. But, over time, the states shifted to choosing electors via the state s popular vote instead. Every state has opted for popular election at least since the Civil War.Calls to AbolishModern opponents of the Electoral College argue against what they call antidemocratic aspects of the institution, criticizing both the intermediary electors and the state-by-state system of voting.Calls to fundamentally change the Electoral College reached a peak after Republican George W. Bush defeated Democrat Al Gore in the tightly contested 2000 election. Gore narrowly won the national popular vote, and many of his supporters howled that the system even without the Supreme Court stepping in was unfair.One organization, National Popular Vote, has worked toward eliminating the Electoral College through an amendment to the Constitution or a state compact. National Popular Vote argues that the current system encourages presidential candidates to spend most of their time in  swing states  rather than campaigning for votes across the entire country.This plan for a national popular vote has received a moderate level of support, but Heritage s von Spakovsky has called it bad policy, based on mistaken assumptions. Swing states, he wrote,  can change from election to election, and many states that are today considered to be reliably  blue  or  red  in the presidential race were recently unpredictable. Many states have signed on to a bill that essentially would tie a state s electoral votes to the national popular vote. Those states will pledge to swing all of their electoral votes to the winner of the national vote.But this is because the incentives would be to appeal only to the biggest population centers. Swing states change over time, and the 2016 election could be a prime example of swing-state unpredictability and erosion of the traditional partisan political map.Additionally, if the president were elected by unfiltered national vote, small and rural states would become irrelevant, and campaigns would spend their time in large, populous districts.FINALLY ARE THE DEMOCRATS PROUD OF THIS DISGUSTING MAN WHO CURSES AND LIES?Read more: Daily Signal",0

That possibility has an awful lot of bad implications, including shutting down sidewalks and parts of streets near Trump Tower. It seems, though, that we don t even have to wait for him to be sworn in to witness the effects of his selfish plans. New York City is already seeing them.His already-excessive presence in NYC is actually starting to cripple businesses in the area. The area around Trump Tower, which is also home to some of the nation s biggest retailers, has been swarming with security, Secret Service, and protesters. Entire sections of 5th Avenue get shut down in order to protect King Summer Squash from all the baddies who might be out and about around there.The retailers in trouble include places like Tiffany & Co., Hollister, Polo Ralph Lauren, and Abercrombie & Fitch. Their 5th Avenue stores aren t just their highest-volume locations, they re the flagship stores for all these chains and they depend heavily on the traffic they now aren t getting.Worse, because Trump wants to spend so much time in his grossly ostentatious, gold-plated apartment throughout his term, these stores may face this most, if not every single, weekend for the next four years. Their weekend traffic is very likely much higher than their weekday traffic, for obvious reasons.Tiffany & Co. s main entrance has been closed since Election Day because of protests and the security needed to keep Trump safe. They wouldn t comment on whether their traffic or sales volumes have been affected, and neither would anybody else, but Tiffany doesn t know when or if their 5th Avenue entrance will open again.RBC Capital Markets analyst, Brian Tunick, mentioned that there s a traffic risk there, along with Hollister and Abercrombie & Fitch, due to the security issues.Sure, some people might say,  Oh, these are national chains, so what s the big deal?  The big deal is that there are still people who work at these stores who could lose their jobs if these locations see too much of a drop in sales volume. Trump is a man who promised to bring back the good jobs and ensure Americans have good-paying jobs if he was elected.While there s no guarantee right now that anybody will lose jobs at these stores, there also isn t any guarantee anymore that they won t. Any job losses, or worse, store closures, because of the Cheeto King s need to be at home instead of the White House, where he belongs, will be on his head because he cares more about himself and his comfort than what his presence might do to the areas surrounding his homes.Featured image by Spencer Platt via Getty Images",0

In fact, for most recipients, it is a humiliating position to be in thanks to the public perception that only lazy people who won t work and want to live for free off the government use them. However, one admitted right-wing voter took food stamp shaming to a whole other level when she accosted a dad at her local Walmart who was paying for his groceries using his SNAP benefits. When the woman first confronts the man, he is nice to her, and explains: I put in 50 to 60 hour weeks. I m trying to provide for my family. The woman responds: You re not providing for it, I am. The government is. They take it out of my check. Bullshit they don t. Finally, the man loses his cool and tells this crazy lady to  vote Republican  if she has a problem with the government helping those in need. That s when things really get heated. The woman shoots back: Oh trust me, I am not a bleeding heart fucking liberal. Then the two start bickering back and forth while using copious amounts of profanity, all in full view of their own children and who knows how many other people. Finally, the man tells the woman what he should have said all along:  shut the fuck up. This is what happens when the public is ignorant about who receives SNAP and other benefits and why. See, it s not lazy folks who refuse to get a job who get these benefits. 83 percent of food stamp recipients are homes with children, the elderly, the disabled, and others who can t work. Notice I said can t not won t. Further, many of them, like the man in the video work full time jobs or even multiple jobs.Republicans are always talking about  small government,  but they and their supporters are the ones who are always all up in everyone s business. Who cares how someone pays for their groceries, just since they are paid for?

And what s even sadder is Cruz only picked Fiorina out of sheer logistics   not because he necessarily likes her or thinks she would be a good Vice President. According to Politico:The hope within the campaign is that Fiorina will help Cruz in California, which will award 172 delegates on June 7. Fiorina is scheduled to give the keynote address at this weekend s California Republican Party convention, speaking hours after Cruz takes the stage.The move comes at a time of growing desperation within Cruz circles. Some in the campaign worry that the Texas senator will lose Indiana on Tuesday and lose other key states in May, paving the way for a Trump nomination.Yes, the women who helped dent Silicon Valley and lost a statewide election to Barbara Boxer by 10 percent is the perfect choice for Cruz s California comeback. As it becomes increasingly clear that Trump s negative image will spell certain doom for the GOP in November, Cruz has literally taken it upon himself to pull a John McCain circa 2008. Only this time America knows who Fiorina is, and they don t like her very much.Fiorina suspended her campaign after poor showings in Iowa and New Hampshire and subsequently endorsed Cruz, traveling he country as a surrogate for his campaign.The decision was two weeks in the making as reports surfaced the Cruz campaign was heavily vetting the former CEO, and placed her at the top of a  serious  contender list for V.P. Never before has a losing candidate pulled such a desperate maneuver to save their campaign. Hopefully this comes back to bite them both in the behind.

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2017But, as usual, Trump is completely full of shit.Under Obama s strategy and leadership, the United States military killed over half of the commanders ISIS had and various military strikes wiped out well over 26,000 ISIS fighters (some reports say over 50,000), all while reducing ISIS  territory from a wide swath of the Middle East stretching from Syria through Iraq to just a few remaining city strongholds.In addition, ISIS lost most of their valuable resources and recruitment dramatically declined.And in December 2016, United States officials announced that 75 percent of all ISIS fighters have been killed.By contrast, ISIS cheered when Trump took office and have been using him as a recruitment tool. Trump is also responsible for killing more civilians in nine months than President Obama did in just over two years, which is just helping ISIS radicalize more fighters to their cause.Basically, Trump is waging a desperate destructive campaign to kill the remaining ISIS fighters and leaders so he can boast that he is  doing more  against ISIS. But his campaign is full of unnecessary collateral damage that is only helping ISIS recruit.In military parlance, Trump s campaign is merely a  mop-up  operation, which is what takes place after the military has already gone in and wiped out most of the enemy forces.President Obama s strategy and leadership resulted in ISIS being crippled. Trump is only getting the crumbs that Obama did not have time to finish off. And he can t even get that right because killing civilians is the best recruitment tool that terrorist organizations like ISIS and al-Qaeda (another terrorist group President Obama crippled) use to remain relevant.So Trump can brag all he wants. It doesn t change the fact that President Obama was a better commander-in-chief.Featured Image: Jack Gruber-Pool/Getty Images",0

Too disgusted, too expensive, too supportive of ego maniacs whose words have the value of quicksand,  he wrote in an email to a Republican fundraiser seeking political contributions. It is demoralizing to me to see adults worshipping a false idol. I can t continue to write checks for anyone,  he said.  I know what it s like to lose a country. It gets worse. Fernandez called Trump one of the worst words in the English language   for forced-birth Republicans. He called Trump an  abortion of a human being. If I was the doctor and knew what that baby would do, I d have made sure it never would have seen the light of day,  he said of the president.The most interesting thing about all of this is that this might be what it takes for Republicans to wake up. Face it, they aren t going to grow a set of balls (to paraphrase Fernandez) any time in the near future, but they will be terrified of losing their donor base.Billionaires, more than anyone, care about how our country is perceived on the world stage. Chaos means market uncertainty, which is never a good thing for the moneyed class. If Trump continues down his current path, he will soon start losing the confidence of the GOP donor base. If Congress doesn t do something about him, look for all of the Trump sycophant members of Congress to be primaried, by the people who have all the money.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",0

Here s more via Jessica Castro, an anchor for ABC7 out of the Bay Area:#breaking Target will increase its minimum wage nationwide to $15 by 2020; If you work there, this means RAISES next month! #livedesk pic.twitter.com/0BXcHJoBdC  Jessica Castro (@JessicaABC7) September 25, 2017Republicans have repeatedly tried to make the case that raising wages kills jobs and raises prices, but that s not true. Target is making the right call. The current federal minimum wage, at $7.25, is extremely low compared to historic averages when adjusted for inflation.In fact, when you adjust for inflation, the minimum wage has steadily dropped since 1968.Republicans also try to make the case that most minimum wage workers have just entered the workforce and are not supporting families on their income (i.e. are students). This, too, is false. Less than half of minimum wage workers are aged 16-24. Additionally, tens of millions of hardworking Americans are paid nearly minimum wage, and would also be affected by proposed raises. It s not high schoolers with after-school jobs being paid minimum wage   it s anybody working a job at a business that can get away with shifting the burden of its employees to the public.And make no mistake   if you re a taxpayer, you re supporting underpaid employees. People working full-time (or part-time and can t get more hours) who are under the poverty line are eligible for benefits, and many choose to take them, being partial to eating and whatnot. That means if a business isn t paying their employees enough to eat, the government has to subsidize that employee. If a business can t afford a living wage, it has no right to exist.From Pew Research:While the idea of raising the minimum wage is broadly popular, a Pew Research Center survey this past August found clear partisan and racial differences in support. Overall, 52% of people favored increasing the federal minimum to $15 an hour, but that idea was favored by just 21% of Trump supporters (versus 82% of Clinton backers). And while large majorities of blacks and Hispanics supported a $15 federal minimum wage, 54% of whites opposed it.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",0
1064,"When former FBI director James Comey refused to testify before Congress in a closed session, it seemed odd to many who have been paying attention to the Donald Trump/Russia scandal. Comey was fired shortly after requesting more funding for the investigation into Trump and his associates  likely collusion with Russia. In Comey s termination letter, Donald Trump thanked him for confirming three times that he was not under investigation   though Comey s colleagues say no such thing happened.According to numerous reports, Comey had begun receiving daily   rather than weekly   reports on the investigation in the time before he was fired. So why was he unwilling to testify? Because he wants this shit to go down in public.One of Comey s associates strategically leaked to the New York Times that Comey would be willing to speak :Mr. Comey made no comment, but later in the day he declined a request to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday. According to a close associate of Mr. Comey, he is willing to testify, but wants it to be in public.The matter arose in a series of early-morning Twitter messages in which Mr. Trump appeared agitated over news reports on contradictory accounts of his decision to fire Mr. Comey, which came at the same time the F.B.I. is investigating ties between Mr. Trump s associates and Russia. Among other things, he threatened to cancel future White House briefings.The White House s original version of the story was that the president had acted on the recommendation of the attorney general and deputy attorney general and fired Mr. Comey because of his handling of last year s investigation into Hillary Clinton s emails. But in an interview with NBC News on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he had already decided to fire Mr. Comey and would have done so regardless of any recommendation. He also indicated that he was thinking about the Russia investigation when he decided.What does Comey know? Trump, who demanded a loyalty pledge multiple times that the ousted director turned down, recently threatened to release  tapes  of their conversations. Trump did not say what was on these alleged tapes, but The Donald s Nixonian outburst reveals that he s incredibly nervous about whatever it is that Comey knows.As for Comey? He hopes there are tapes.A source close to Comey told me this morning:  He hopes there are tapes. That would be perfect.  Ken Dilanian (@KenDilanianNBC) May 12, 2017Featured image via screengrab",0

Trump demonstrated his idiocy to the world earlier this week when he responded to the terrorist attack in London by using the tragedy as an opportunity to promote his Muslim travel ban.Trump got blasted on social media for his disgusting, insensitive response   but top Democrat Nancy Pelosi found the perfect way to slam Trump   by actually showing him how he SHOULD HAVE responded. Unlike Trump, Pelosi didn t blame London s Mayor or use it to promote any agenda. Her response was completely presidential and serves as a perfect example of how Trump should behave while completely humiliating him at the same time.In a beautiful statement of solidarity, Pelosi said: Today, the American people stand in solidarity with the people of the United Kingdom, and share in the shock and outrage of this brutal attack. We send our thoughts and prayers to the fallen, the injured and those still waiting for news of their loved ones. Terrorists will not succeed in dimming the strength and spirit of the people of the United Kingdom. Last night s vile attack   the third act of terror to target the United Kingdom in three months   was met with courage and resilience from first responders and from civilian heroes who refused to be intimidated by violence and hatred. And unlike Trump, Pelosi reached out to our allies to send a message of unity instead of divisiveness: The United States will continue to proudly work side-by-side with the U.K. to defeat terrorist threats and defend the security of all peace-loving people. May the people of the United Kingdom find solace in knowing that the American people stand with them during this difficult time. Hopefully, Trump will see Pelosi s response and a light bulb will go off in his head, but we all know he s incapable of learning from his mistakes so that s not going to happen.Pelosi s response is the kind of reaction that we d come to expect from our leaders, especially after having eight amazing years under former President Barack Obama. Unfortunately, we ve gone in quite the opposite direction under Trump. Every time there is an incident, Trump further humiliates America and insults the world with his response.Featured image via Alex Wong and Win McNamee/Getty Images",0
687,"Ben and Jerry, the  ber liberal Vermont ice cream guys, are no fans of Donald Trump and in a blistering and sarcastic op-ed, they sarcastically explained how pulling out of the Paris climate treaty was the right thing to do.The op-ed, on their website, is tongue-in-cheek, but also bitter (a terrible suggestion for a Ben & Jerry s flavor). They talk about the jobs that will be lost:We hear China is ramping up their renewable energy production and it sure looks like a lot of work. Beijing alone plans to invest $360 billion in renewables by 2020, creating more than 13 million jobs. But jobs are work! Work is hard! It s so much easier to luxuriate in the status quo, driving our fossil-fuel-powered cars and enjoying our coal-created electricity like we always have.It s also quite personal for them. The cost of cocoa beans and vanilla will rise dramatically over the coming years.Then, there s the fact that we are one of only three countries who have chosen not to participate. That means we will no longer have a seat at the table and it means that for all intents and purposes, we can no longer call ourselves a superpower.Ben & Jerry go on to talk about the wonderful ocean views we ll all soon have:Who doesn t love oceanfront property? With runaway climate change melting glaciers and causing sea levels to rise at unprecedented rates, a whole lot more of us could be seeing waves from our bedroom windows. Sure, some folks might lose their homes and businesses, and our coastal cities could see devastating changes, but a whole lot of people will also be able to learn how to surf right in their backyards. Sounds like a fair tradeoff to us.They also look forward to the impending world crises, which make  life exciting.

707,"Donald Trump is a liar. Not the kind of lies that qualify as little white lies or harmless little fibs. He doesn t just exaggerate a little or embellish his stories. No, Donald Trump qualifies for full pants on fire status. A recent study of nearly 40 hours of campaign footage by Politico found that The Donald lies on average every five minutes. go ahead and read that again and take it in for all it s worth: Donald Trump tells a bald-faced lie every five minutes he s at a podium.His followers eat it up. Whether he s inventing numbers about trade deficits, creating success stories that definitely never actually happened to him or defending his bankruptcies, out-of-court settlements and failed business ventures, Donald Trump truly personifies the old adage that you can tell if he s lying if his lips are moving. Politico stated:We chronicled 4.6 hours of stump speeches and press conferences, from a rally in Concord, N.C., on Monday to a rally on Friday in St. Louis.The result: more than five dozen statements deemed mischaracterizations, exaggerations, or simply false   the kind of stuff that would have been stripped from one of our stories, or made the whole thing worthy of the spike. It equates to roughly one misstatement every five minutes on average.They also produced a video of some of those lies   captioned with the truth   for your viewing pleasure:How anyone can take this buffoon seriously is a mystery. While most Republicans are well-known for blaming the problems they and their party created for our country on Democrats, specifically President Obama, Trump is content to lie when the truth goes better. For example, we have a $366 billion trade deficit with China, which Trump has repeatedly exaggerated to $500 billion. Is that extra $134 billion really that important? Most middle and working class Americans struggle to keep $1000 in the bank, Donald. $366 billion more than makes the point.Another fan favorite is the ever-benevolent Trump and his  self-funded  campaign. Trump has passed the $7 million mark on donations from people who hit the big blue  donate  button on his website, and the bulk of his  self-funding  comes in the form of a $17.5 million loan from Donald J Trump. That loan can be repaid anytime up until shortly after his campaign ends. Trump s actual personal contributions total a little over $200K.That s how good  Christians  like Donald Trump operate. They hide behind lies. The truth that they are corporate lackeys looking to better their personal portfolios and secure a future for old, white, male America isn t so easy to campaign on, so they conjure a truth that fits their dialogue. In Trump s case, the truth is far more frightening than most, if not all, Republicans who have come before him: He wants the presidency so he can enjoy the pinnacle of power and blow things up.Not exactly a good enough reason to hand a lunatic the nuclear football but hey, you can t blame a megalomaniac for trying.Featured image from Gage Skidmore",0

613,"President Obama used the platform of his weekly address from the White House to address the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. In his speech, the President sought to remind Americans of their best qualities as we saw in the response to the horrific attack.In his weekly radio and Internet address, Obama said that while so much has changed in the years since 9/11 it s important to remember what has stayed the same.  The core values that define us as Americans. The resilience that sustains us,  he said on the eve of the 15th anniversary of one of the nation s darkest days.He said the terrorists  goal is to frighten Americans into changing how they live, but  Americans will never give in to fear. We re still the America of heroes who ran into harm s way, of ordinary folks who took down the hijackers, of families who turned their pain into hope,  Obama said.The idea that America has to eye all Muslims with suspicion since 9/11 has unfortunately gone from a fringe belief to a central concern of the conservative movement. Current Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has argued that Muslims should be barred from entry to the United States, and has even suggested that they be tracked somehow. He and other Republicans also claim that Muslims aren t helping America in the war against terrorism, but they have laid down their lives right alongside Christian patriots in the last decade and a half.President Obama s message is one of inclusion not exclusion, arguing that the American instinct was seen in its purest form after the attack, when so many were united in a common cause.The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 killed almost 3,000 people in New York City, at the Pentagon, and in Pennsylvania. The assault was executed by the al Qaeda terrorist network and ordered by leader Osama bin Laden.

54,"If you re sitting at your computer, take a deep breath. If you re reading this on your phone, have a seat. Everything you think you know about how bad the Trump administration s response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico has been is about to get a whole lot worse.On Rachel Maddow s show Monday night, she discussed a small town in the mountains of Puerto Rico called Aibonito, roughly one and a half hours from the capital city of San Juan. If it seems like you re getting a geography lesson lately, that s good   even if it is because of listening to Trump trash talk mayors and citizens or watching him pelt churchgoers with rolls of paper towels.Showing video taken from a moving vehicle, Rachel describes the roads from the capital to Aibonito: Clear. Unblocked. As the cameras travel with the MSNBC team, you hear the point of Rachel s report, which is that after almost three weeks since the storm, FEMA still has not brought relief to the mountain town. And to hear them tell it, there s a reason.It s not their job.FEMA still has not delivered food or water to the completely accessible town. And make no mistake, FEMA knows that Aibonito is accessible at this point, because they ve been there three times. All three times, FEMA was on the scene to  help residents fill out paperwork  to apply for aid. Let s drag that acronym out into what it stands for: The Federal Emergency Management Agency. Heading to a remote mountain town that s been waiting three weeks for food and water to assist the pueblo in asking for help doesn t sound like anyone is managing any emergencies to me.Rachel first ran a profile on Aibonito on Friday, which is how she knew that FEMA had been there three times. After she ran that report, FEMA contacted her show, desperate to let the public know that they had once again made the literally unimpeded journey to Aibonito on Saturday, this time to speak to the mayor and file a report on the needs of the community. Still no food or water in their undoubtedly spacious trucks.The death toll in Puerto Rico has more than doubled since Donald Trump told the residents there that they should be grateful so few had died.But the part that will piss you off is the comparison between how the Trump administration has handled this  emergency management  as opposed to the emergencies in Texas and Florida. Shipping restrictions are back in place in Puerto Rico, making what little aid is coming hard to receive. The administration initially refused to lift a restriction on using food stamps to purchase ready-to-eat food, despite the grocery stores on the island being mostly closed until within the last week, and despite those stores that have reopened jacking up their prices. That s not how it went in the mainland US, where the  white people s hurricanes  saw victims able to use their food stamps to purchase McDonald s on day one, and where the federal government stepped in to help municipalities fight price gouging.There can be little doubt that the  emergency management  in Puerto Rico has suffered from a lack of compassion, and that erasing everything that puertorrique os have in common with Texans and Floridians   American citizenship, basic humanity, dire need   what s left is that they are a Spanish-speaking people. They are brown and seem foreign. They are underdogs, with a flag that isn t the same shape as the flags of the individual United States that fly at the same height: Just below the American flag.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",0

But in America s current climate of fear and unease about what will happen with health care in this country, it was President Obama s speech that was particularly emblematic of the struggle we face in determining the outcome of the American way of life when it comes to insurance, medical care, and ongoing health concerns.This is in stark contrast with what we see in everyday life in America, where we seemingly can t even agree on whether or not white supremacists are bad, or if it s okay to run over protesters. We are engaged in a fight for our very lives, and at least legislatively speaking, Obama knows how hard it looks from where we are.From the video you re about to watch: [W]hen I see those people trying to undo that hard-won progress, for the 50th or 60th time, with bills that would raise costs or reduce coverage, or roll back protections for older Americans or people with pre-existing conditions   the cancer survivor, the expecting mom, or the child with autism, or asthma, for whom coverage once again would be almost unattainable  it is aggravating.And all of this being done without any demonstrable economic, or actuarial, or plain common sense rationale   it frustrates. And it s certainly frustrating to have to mobilize every couple months to keep our leaders from inflicting real human suffering on our constituents. President Obama couldn t be more right. Although he is diplomatic here and does not call out Donald Trump and the Republicans by name, it is vital that we hold them to account. It is absolutely imperative that we make sure they cannot tear away at the fabric of our society and rip away at the moral cloth we ve woven in beginning the process of ensuring every American has access to health care.Watch the video here:Featured image via Yana Paskova/Getty Images",0

686,"Donald Trump has never been Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell s (R-KY) favorite person. That uneasy relationship deteriorated further in recent days and weeks, as Trump proceeded to openly mock and humiliate McConnell, blaming him for everything from the failed attempts to repeal Obamacare to the entire situation of the fractured GOP s stalled agenda. Now, since Trump had such a disgraceful response to the white supremacist violence in Charlottesville that resulted in the death of anti-racism activist Heather Heyer and the injuries of countless others, it seems that Trump and McConnell are engaged in what the New York Times is calling their own little, quote,  cold war. According to the new bombshell report, Trump doesn t even talk to McConnell   the one most important man in the legislative branch when it comes to getting his agenda passed. The New York Times reports: The relationship between President Trump and Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, has disintegrated to the point that they have not spoken to each other in weeks, and Mr. McConnell has privately expressed uncertainty that Mr. Trump will be able to salvage his administration after a series of summer crises.What was once an uneasy governing alliance has curdled into a feud of mutual resentment and sometimes outright hostility.The article further suggests that when Trump and McConnell were speaking, Trump didn t just keep his taunts to the usual juvenile derision via Twitter. No, apparently, on August 9th, McConnell and Trump had some kind of conversation, and Trump could not help going after McConnell to his face. There are no details regarding exactly what was said, but knowing Trump, it was likely pretty scathing and humiliating for McConnell, who seems to consider himself your typical dignified grown man. He is likely simply done with Trump s playground bully behavior and is no longer going to dignify Trump s ignorance and taunts with responses.It also doesn t help that McConnell s wife, Elaine Chao, is Trump s Transportation Secretary. She is an immigrant, and arrived from Taiwan as a child, speaking no English. Under Trump s new immigration plans, she would never have been allowed into this country. Further, to top it all off, Secretary Chao had to be humiliated standing next to Trump during his Charlottesville tirade, in which he defended white supremacists. Think about that   how it must have made McConnell feel to see his wife being used that way in such a despicable, bigoted, and unhinged Trump rant.All of this has resulted in much more criticism than one would expect from Mitch McConnell in public, but, according to the Times, McConnell is much more angry with Trump than he is letting on, and he is even wondering if Trump will be the GOP s leader for much longer, given his recent behavior. Again, from the New York Times:Mr. McConnell has fumed over Mr. Trump s regular threats against fellow Republicans and criticism of Senate rules, and questioned Mr. Trump s understanding of the presidency in a public speech. Mr. McConnell has made sharper comments in private, describing Mr. Trump as entirely unwilling to learn the basics of governing.In offhand remarks, Mr. McConnell has expressed a sense of bewilderment about where Mr. Trump s presidency may be headed, and has mused about whether Mr. Trump will be in a position to lead the Republican Party into next year s elections and beyond, according to people who have spoken to him directly.All in all, those two might never speak again. The thing is, though, Donald Trump has severely underestimated Mitch McConnell s power. The GOP took a chance and hitched their wagon to this ignorant, incompetent orange fool because their voters left them no choice. However, they now clearly regret it   and said regret just might be inching toward hastening Trump s removal from office.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",0
311,"Star Trek legend George Takei gloriously shredded Donald Trump s dipshit son in a column which includes a poem for Trump Jr. to read to pass the time in his prison cell.As we all know by now, Trump Jr. released an email chain of himself agreeing to a meeting with a Russian lawyer who offered to give the Trump campaign dirt on Hillary Clinton to use in the 2016 Election. The information was received from the Russian government through Aras Agalarov, a Russian oligarch who is close to Vladimir Putin and one of Donald Trump s friends.It has since been revealed that a former Soviet intelligence officer also attended the meeting, which took place inside Trump Tower.In a scathing column published on Saturday, Takei recounts the news of the scandal and proceeds to inform Trump Jr. that he is going to jail. The latest  I can t believe this actually happened  bombshell concerns, of course, not Trump himself but his namesake, Donald, Jr., whose emails confirming Russian support for his father and meddling in the election present such low hanging evidentiary fruit that even Jeffrey Beauregard Sessions III could pick them,  Takei wrote.The emails, released by Junior in advance of a damning story by the Times, no doubt in a vain attempt to blunt the story s impact or at least divert its media coverage, has had something of the opposite effect. Importantly, Junior also had copied then-campaign manager Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner on his response, indicating that the campaign s senior staff were willing to accept damaging information on the Democratic opponent from a foreign hostile state. Their subsequent attendance of the meeting confirmed this. In attendance at the meeting itself was not only a lawyer from the Russian government but also a known Russian counterintelligence officer. The story grows, and darkens. This email string thus comprises the first direct evidence of coordination between the campaign and the Russians, but unlikely the last.In light of these damning revelations, Takei wrote a poem to commemorate Trump Jr s crimes against the United States.Lest there be any confusionDon Jr. has dispelled the illusionHis emails revealedWhat they thought was concealedNow he s gonna do time for collusionTakei went on to point out that on the very same day of the meeting, Trump wrote a speech about how Russia has a  blackmail file  on Clinton, and delivered it later that same month along with a plea to Russian hackers to continue attacking her and the DNC in search of emails.Takei couldn t resist taking note of the irony of it all.The president, in tepid defense of his son, remarked that Junior is a  good boy,  a  high-quality person,  and that he applauds his  transparency.  I can t but help think the president probably wishes that level of transparency would render Junior invisible right about now. For with now another member of his immediate family caught up in the Russia investigation, and the curious timing of his speeches, it becomes increasingly implausible that all this was happening without the president s knowledge.And what poetic irony it would be if Trump s downfall resulted from emails.Indeed, it would not only be  poetic irony,  but poetic justice as well.Featured Image: Frederick M.

101,"Pope Francis used his annual Christmas Day message to rebuke Donald Trump without even mentioning his name. The Pope delivered his message just days after members of the United Nations condemned Trump s move to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The Pontiff prayed on Monday for the  peaceful coexistence of two states within mutually agreed and internationally recognized borders. We see Jesus in the children of the Middle East who continue to suffer because of growing tensions between Israelis and Palestinians,  Francis said.  On this festive day, let us ask the Lord for peace for Jerusalem and for all the Holy Land. Let us pray that the will to resume dialogue may prevail between the parties and that a negotiated solution can finally be reached. The Pope went on to plead for acceptance of refugees who have been forced from their homes, and that is an issue Trump continues to fight against. Francis used Jesus for which there was  no place in the inn  as an analogy. Today, as the winds of war are blowing in our world and an outdated model of development continues to produce human, societal and environmental decline, Christmas invites us to focus on the sign of the Child and to recognize him in the faces of little children, especially those for whom, like Jesus,  there is no place in the inn,  he said. Jesus knows well the pain of not being welcomed and how hard it is not to have a place to lay one s head,  he added.  May our hearts not be closed as they were in the homes of Bethlehem. The Pope said that Mary and Joseph were immigrants who struggled to find a safe place to stay in Bethlehem. They had to leave their people, their home, and their land,  Francis said.  This was no comfortable or easy journey for a young couple about to have a child.   At heart, they were full of hope and expectation because of the child about to be born; yet their steps were weighed down by the uncertainties and dangers that attend those who have to leave their home behind. So many other footsteps are hidden in the footsteps of Joseph and Mary,  Francis said Sunday. We see the tracks of entire families forced to set out in our own day. We see the tracks of millions of persons who do not choose to go away, but driven from their land, leave behind their dear ones. Amen to that.Photo by Christopher Furlong/Getty Images.",0
172,"It s official. Donald Trump is literally trying to murder the American people.As humans, we need clean air and clean water to survive as a species. Without them, we would suffocate or die of thirst. Crops and livestock also require clean water and clean air to produce our food supply.This is basic stuff, but Donald Trump doesn t care about the needs of human beings. He only cares about corporate greed and that greed is going to kill millions.Trump has already launched an all-out assault on the Environmental Protection Agency, which works every day fighting for clean water and clean air for the American people.The agency has been ordered to freeze grants and contracts which has halted air and water quality tests.But now Trump is looking to chip away at the bedrock of what the EPA exists to do.According to Vox,Jonathan Swan of Axios got a look at an  agency action  plan that Trump s advisers have written up for the EPA. Among the initiatives they plan to target:  Clean Air Act greenhouse gas regulations for new (NSPS) and existing (ESPS or the  Clean Power  Plan) coal and natural gas power plants   [CAFE] Standards   Clean Water Section 404: Waters of the U.S. Rule (wetlands)   TMDL (Total Maximum Daily Load) for Chesapeake Bay. By attacking the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, Trump would be sentencing America to a deadly polluted future the likes of which have not been seen since the EPA was created.Americans look at Beijing in horror as China allows the air in that city to be so thick and poisonous that people need to wear gas masks every day if they go outside.Here s an image of New York in 1973 before the EPA aggressively fought for air standards via the National Archives.And here s one of Los Angeles.If Trump has his way, American cities will once again be choked by smog and our air quality with significantly decrease. One wonders if Trump has investments in gas mask companies.Fresh water has also been a worry among millions of Americans over the years as Republicans continue to make decisions that allow companies like Koch Industries to pollute our waterways. Trump s executive order to let the Keystone XL pipeline move forward is a direct threat to the Ogallala Aquifer, which provides water to millions of Americans in the Midwest and is responsible for creating what is now called  America s Breadbasket. The Washington Post reports,In some places the aquifer is buried 1,200 feet deep, but in many places it is at or very close to the surface, often less than five feet below ground That s where concerns about the Keystone XL came in. Its original route traversed 92 miles of the Sand Hills and the Ogallala. TransCanada, which said it would bury the pipeline at least four feet underground, could in many places be putting it in water TransCanada submitted a revised route to the State Department, bypassing the Sand Hills but still passing over some parts of the aquifer.Should a massive oil spill occur, it could seep into the aquifer and poison it. And that would be a disaster even bigger than the lead poisoned water in Flint, Michigan because it would literally affect every American across the country.And these spills can contaminate water for decades. The reason why Flint s water supply was tainted with lead is because Republicans decided to save money by switching the city s water from Lake Huron to the Flint River, which was contaminated by lead decades ago, which is why Flint got it s water from Lake Huron. This is public knowledge, but Republicans ignored that and switched anyway.Trump also wants to expedite oil and gas permits and open up pristine natural lands to fracking and mining, which threatens habitats and our water supply. As we should all know, fracking has already poisoned water supplies in places around the country. Some people can even light their water on fire because of the chemicals fracking companies use. That will increase under Trump.Republicans now control Congress, so they will likely help Trump weaken the Clean Water and Clean Air Acts no matter how much the American people protest.So by letting Trump and the Republicans remain in office we are letting them kill us.

An obviously nervous and intimidated Jeff Sessions skirted around a lot of tough questions asked by Senators about Trump and Russia.

962,"Like father, like son, Donald Trump Jr. twitter account is getting him into a lot of trouble.The morning after Republican Karen Handel won the Georgia special election to fill in a vacant seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, Don Jr. was giddy and eager to brag about the win. Sidestepping the fact that Handel had to spend $18 million (two-and-a-half times her opponent!) to win a nailbitter in a district Republicans won by over 20 points just 7 months ago, Don Jr. chose to focus on the  historic  nature of the win: Karen is a woman.Karen Handel becomes 1st Woman Rep GA has sent to Congress. Still waiting for the glass ceiling stories, or do conservatives not get them?  Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) June 21, 2017Unfortunately for Don Jr., his tweet shows the dangers of getting all your information from right-wing media. It s completely wrong.Handel is not the first woman representative Georgia has sent to Congress. Democrats have been electing women in Georgia for years. And Democrats elected the state s first congresswoman Cynthia McKinney in 2005. The  glass ceiling  was shattered in Georgia long ago   and by Democrats.Unintentionally, Don Jr gave America an opportunity to look at just how backwards the Republican Party is. As The Hill notes, the GOP is pathetically behind on gender equality for their elected officials.Handel will become just the 22nd GOP female lawmaker in the 435-member House, not including nonvoting delegates. Overall, there are 104 women in the House.In the Senate, there are 21 women, including five Republicans.Georgia has sent a handful of Democratic women to Congress, most recently Rep. Cynthia McKinney, who served one term from 2005 to 2007.Nine other states appear to have never sent a Republican woman to Congress: Arkansas, Delaware, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota, Oregon, South Carolina, Vermont and Wisconsin.Republicans have yet to send a single woman to Congress in nine states. That s just sad. And waiting until 2017 to finally start to catch up shouldn t allow Republicans to get any  glass ceiling  points. This year they are particularly guilty. Republicans chose to stand by a man who had repeatedly sexually harassed women around him, bragged about it on tape, and later used sexist attacks against both his critics in the media and his opponent. They elected him president and continue to support him.Don Jr., having been humiliated for passing along the false information, decided to lie about it rather than just admit his mistake and move on. In a bit of shameless dishonesty his own father might blush at, he claimed the  Rep  in his tweet   universally understood to be short for  representative    really meant  Republican. How do we know it s a lie? Because his original tweet makes absolutely no sense if we replace  Representative  with  Republican.  As the above tweet illustrates, McKinney broke the glass ceiling   for all women in Georgia. A decade ago. Republicans don t get to shatter the already-shattered glass ceiling 12 years too late, much less celebrate it as a huge step forward in women s rights.Nice try, Don. Glad to see you re becoming your father s son!Featured image via David Becker/Getty Images",0
577,"As the investigations into how Russia meddled in our election escalate, Facebook has turned records relating to ad buys from Russian actors over to Congress. Facebook has found itself in the crosshairs of Democrats and Republicans alike because of this (and for other reasons), and Mark Zuckerberg is finally, finally wondering if maybe he should be taking a more active role in his own company.Why? Because Facebook sold over 3,000 pro-Trump and pro-right wing ads to fake accounts run by Russians and people with ties to Russia. They turned those records over to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees and to Special Counsel Robert Mueller. They re going to re-evaluate the processes they use to review political ads, and they will supposedly  offer a higher standard of transparency  on those ads than what the law requires for radio, television and other platforms.For many, it s too little, too late, though. Trump was elected, a hostile foreign power helped him win, and the true scope of how Russia used and manipulated Facebook is still unknown. When they first came under fire for allowing the proliferation of fake news following Trump s  win,  Zuckerberg s excuse was that they were a technology company, not a media company. The implication was that they couldn t be held responsible for any of that.They re only now starting to come around to the truth, but the sad thing about this is that Zuckerberg was warned about people misusing his platform to swing the election several times. In fact, none other than President Obama himself literally pulled Zuckerberg aside during a conference in Peru to practically beg him to take the threat of fake news and disinformation seriously. Obama told Zuckerberg that, unless he actually paid attention, this would only be worse in four years.But Zuckerberg blew him off. He told Obama that such messages weren t widespread on his platform, and that there wouldn t be an easy solution to it. Like his pathetic excuse of being a tech company, Zuckerberg shirked any and all responsibility for it. Obama tried. Zuckerberg didn t really seem to care.Discovering that another country would even dare to try and influence our elections should be a horrific epiphany for any American. It s true that neither Zuckerberg, nor anyone else at Facebook (or anyone really) could have sufficiently predicted that anything like this would happen. As recently as two to three years ago, most of us would have made fun of the conspiracy theorists making bizarre claims about shady and hostile foreign actors working to swing our elections to their favor. That s reality now, but early warnings like Obama s seem to have slid right off Zuckerberg s back, as he was more concerned with his product than with how his product was being misused.Russia weaponized Facebook, and it s not over. Facebook has its part to do and they need to get to it post-haste. But another part may lie with Washington, with our lawmakers. It may well be time to apply laws similar to those that govern political advertising elsewhere to social media. Facebook hasn t yet provided many details about how they ll be transparent, especially given the fact that many of their political ads don t meet current legal definitions for political ads. They are, however, talking the talk. Now they need to walk the walk, or be forced to do so under law.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",0
566,"The CEO of outdoor clothing giant Patagonia is burnishing her anti-Republican bona fides again, this time saying she intends to pledge her entire company to the  resistance  of President Donald Trump.Patagonia CEO Rose Marcario recently attacked President Trump for his statements about rolling back President Obama s unusually aggressive campaign of confiscating millions of acres of state lands and claiming them as  national monuments. We have to fight like hell to keep every inch of public land,  Marcario said in a May article at Huffpost.  I don t have a lot of faith in politics and politicians right now. In an effort to prevent citizens from retaking possession of their state lands, one of her immediate actions will be to sue the Trump administration for its efforts to scale back Obama s unprecedented land grab. A president does not have the authority to rescind a national monument,  Marcario said in an April 26 statement after Trump announced his national monuments order.  An attempt to change the boundaries ignores the review process of cultural and historical characteristics and the public input. In particular, the Trump administration is preparing to revisit Obama s order to create the Bears Ears National Monument. In April, Trump issued an executive order requiring the Department of the Interior to review Obama s actions on national monuments. Ordering Interior Secretary Ray Zinke to review Obama s policies in April, President Trump called Obama s move an  egregious abuse of federal power. Many state governments fully agree with Trump s assessment and were furious when Obama swooped in from Washington and stole away millions of acres of land from state control to create new national monuments and parks.A poll of residents of Utah, for instance, showed that 60 percent opposed Obama s land grab, while only 33 percent supported it.This is far from the first time the sportswear company pledged its profits to political matters. Last year, the California-based company spent over $1 million for a get-out-the-vote campaign to defeat Donald Trump and Republicans.  BreitbartPatagonia is an accredited and founding member of the Fair Labor Association; its website is as much an educational tool about environmental and social responsibility filled with information on issues such as preservation of land in Chile, labeling GMO products, and responsible sourcing as it is an online store. In a note launching the company s food division, Patagonia Provisions, company founder Yvon Chouinard restated the brand s central ethos:  We aim to make the best product, cause no unnecessary harm, and perhaps most important, inspire solutions to the environmental crisis. And yet, despite these aspirations, four years ago internal audits turned up multiple instances of human trafficking, forced labor, and exploitation in Patagonia s supply chain, according to Cara Chacon, the company s director of social and environmental responsibility, and Thuy Nguyen, the manager of supply chain social responsibility and special programs.",0

1016,"Earlier this week, Devin Nunes finally recused himself from the House Intel Committee s probe on Russian election tampering, putting Mike Conaway of Texas in charge. Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the panel, remains in place. Schiff has been working tirelessly to ensure that Nunes  decision to leak classified info, and to talk to Agent Cheeto before the rest of his committee, doesn t derail the House s investigation any more than it has to.But some Republicans are apparently unhappy with Schiff still being there. One such Republican is former House Intel Chairman Mike Rogers, who seems to think that if Nunes had to recuse himself from the probe, then Schiff should likewise recuse himself. His reasoning is almost as batty as Mike Conaway s reasoning that Mexican performing artists are the same as Russian hackers: Representative Adam Schiff should consider recusing himself from the probe. For his part, Schiff suggested to the media that he had seen information on Russia-Trump campaign ties that was  the kind of evidence  that would be presented to a grand jury, adding that he had seen additional evidence, but not elaborating further. He went on to ask how the committee could continue doing its business when secret information is publicly discussed, even by innuendo. Except Schiff didn t go running to others with documents in hand. He simply explained how he interpreted what he had seen, without revealing what he had seen.Republicans seem to be incapable of making valid comparisons.Rogers has a serious problem with Schiff because he believes that Schiff politicized the committee s investigation. He couldn t be more wrong. It was Nunes who politicized it when he took information directly to Trump before presenting it to the rest of the committee.Rogers is right about one thing: The committee needs to get back on track as soon as possible. That won t happen without Schiff, though, because he s been relentless in trying to keep the committee on track. Rogers  call for him to recuse himself positively reeks of,  No fair!

1035,"People have figured out a way to troll a right-wing pastor who incessantly rails against transgender Americans, Planned Parenthood, and pretty much anything else that doesn t fit into his pathetic, bigoted world view and help the women s health organization at the same time and it s driving him bananas. Recently, far-Right hate pastor Greg Locke posted an allcaps message on his Facebook timeline:PLANNED PARENTHOOD SENT ME A PERSONAL  THANK YOU  AND IT HAS ME LIT.And boy is he  lit!  Locke explains that he received the  thank you  letter from his favorite  baby parts  boogeyman after an an undisclosed amount was donated in his honor by a woman named Krista Ginsberg in Houston, Texas. At the end of the day, it doesn t matter how big or how small it was, it was a waste of your money and the stamp was a waste of your money,  Locke raves in the video.  Don t ever send me anymore nonsense from Planned Parenthood. There has never been an organization in the world that has killed more innocent people other than radical Islam than that of Planned Parenthood,  Locke lied. Naturally, he did not cite a source for the claim.  Look, I m just gonna say it whether you like it or not   Planned Parenthood does not give one flip of a wooden nickel about women s healthcare. It s a bunch of deceptive individuals that are in it for the money that have been known to sell baby parts on the black market and they have done nothing but butcher innocent lives for years. It s safe to assume that Locke was referencing abortion there, which is only three percent of the total services Planned Parenthood provides women. The organization absolutely has not  been known  outside of certain circles of people who can barely operate a fork without adult supervision to sell  baby parts on the black market.  Previously, the organization accepted reimbursements to cover the costs of preparing and shipping donated fetal tissue, but it has since stopped accepting the reimbursements because of liars and zealots like Locke. As far as I m concerned, I don t care if I ever get another piece of literature from you guys again because you re just wasting your money to send me this nonsense,  Locke says, adding that  Pastor Greg Locke has absolutely positively tee-totally nothing to  do with Planned Parenthood. Y all can keep butchering babies, I m gonna keep speaking the truth,  he concludes after throwing the nice thank you letter in the garbage.Apparently, some awesome people decided to get together and go to Planned Parenthood s donation page, where they filled out the form and made a donation   of course carefully checking the  Yes, my gift is in honor or in memory of someone special  box where they entered Locke s information and the address of his church (2060 Old Lebanon Dirt Rd in Mt. Juliet, TN zip code 37122) so Planned Parenthood knew where to send their thanks. not that we re encouraging you to do it or anything. You should totally do it.Within a week of his initial posting, Locke complained about all the love he is getting from enthusiastic supporters of women s healthcare. Apparently, there have been  HUNDREDS OF DONATIONS  in his name.Not only is this a win for Planned Parenthood, but the look on Locke s face in the video is worth every cent that is donated.Watch Locke s unhinged ravings below:Featured image via screengrab",0

Just after gutting health care for up to 24 million Americans, then throwing a kegger for Republicans who were complicit in an attack on their own constituents, Donald Trump decided to take a vacay and go golfing.This morning Trump tweeted from his social media podium,  Rather than causing a big disruption in N.Y.C., I will be working out of my home in Bedminster, N.J. this weekend.

The former reality show star thinks being leader of the free world is a 9-5 type of gig with an extra day off for knifing the poor and middle class.During the same period of time in Barack Obama s presidency, he golfed once. One time. And Donald Trump repeatedly disparaged him for it. As of April 2nd, Trump spent nine consecutive weekends at Trump-owned properties, bringing up once more his mounting conflicts of interest.Trump was already in New York City where he could have spent time with his wife, who is totally in love with him, and their son, Barron. But, according to Trump, he didn t want to  cause a disruption.  Now far be it from us to call him a Big Old Liar, but Trump didn t remain in NYC, because everyone there hates him. And that may or may not include his wife. Who knows.It s really bad optics to screw the poor over then go golfing with wealthy people. To Trump, saving us money means costing us more money.

782,"Regarding the current North Korea missile crisis, President Trump s teleprompter-led address to the United Nations General Assembly was provocative, and perhaps counter-productive in terms of achieving peace and stability in the Far East region. Some will even say that it ranks as one of the most embarrassing moments in the history of American international diplomacy. 21WIRE editor Patrick Henningsen speaks to RT International about the danger and the rank hypocrisy of the current hawkish US stance against North Korea, and how the current stand-off is also a kind of  stage-managed geopolitical theatre  driven by big money vested interests in US military s bloated Pacific operation, and also about how the US presence in the region is hampering any chance of peace between South and North Korea.

Autopsy results show that Gracia died of sepsis, after wounds from a police canine bite became infected.As WESH reports here, documents released following an internal police investigation show that Gracia was checked into the jail infirmary following his arrest. He was then discharged without ever being evaluated or treated.Records obtained by WESH show that on the night before his death Gracia was so sick that he could not get out of his bed.The documents show that:When jail officers told Gracia to get out of his bed, he  slowly went to the floor and lied on his back saying that he could not move anymore. Instead of offering medical attention, a jail nurse, who later resigned, wrote that the 22-year-old  was faking or exaggerating his medical condition and inability to get up. The nurse interpreted his illness as an  implicit refusal for medication. Gracia was then disciplined by jail officials, who charged him with refusal to follow orders and  feigning an illness. He died in his cell hours later.Here s more on this story from Fox 11:In 2013, the state of Florida privatized healthcare services for inmates. Since that time the number of inmate deaths has steadily increased.Up until May 31, 2016, Corizon, a private corporation which provides healthcare to inmates in a number of states, was responsible for inmate care in Florida.After thousands of inmate complaints and hundreds of unexplained inmate deaths, the company decided to terminate its $1.1 billion contract with the state two years early.As the Miami Herald reports here:Audits conducted by the state s Correctional Medical Authority found problems with inadequate medical care, nursing and staffing shortages, and hundreds of pending lawsuits against the state and the healthcare companies claiming inadequate care.An analysis published by the Miami Herald in November showed that in 2014 alone  346 inmates died in Florida prisons   176 of them listed with no immediate cause of death. It was the highest number on record. The increase in the number of inmate deaths occurred even as the number of inmates in Florida prisons declined.As of June 1, Centurion, another private corporation, will take over inmate care in the state.As the Miami Herald reports:The company s lead lobbyist is former House Speaker Dean Cannon, and its parent company, Centene Health, is a primary provider of managed Medicaid services in Florida   doing business as Sunshine Health   and one of the largest contributors to legislative political committees in the state. Centene gave $298,000 to legislative campaigns and political committees in 2015 alone.",0
579,"Donald Trump s allies would very much like the RNC to cover the legal costs of retaining attorneys amid the inquiries into whether the campaign colluded with the Russian government during the 2016 election. It appears, though, that the alleged president s reelection campaign has already paid a legal firm $50,000 and that was just two weeks before Donald Trump Jr. s email scandal broke.Trump s reelection campaign (that s kind of funny considering that it s hard to determine if the former reality show star will last even a year in office at this point) paid $50,000 to the law offices of Alan Futerfas on June 26, according to a new filing with the Federal Election Commission.The Daily Beast reports:On July 11, the New York Times revealed the contents of a June 2016 email exchange in which Trump Jr., through an associate, solicited damaging information about 2016 election rival Hillary Clinton.Just a day earlier, he had enlisted the services of Futerfas, who is best known for representing four of New York s major Italian mob families. The announcement of the hire came not from the Trump campaign but from the president s company, where Trump Jr. remains a trustee.Perhaps this is why the amateur president holds so many rallies even though he just got into office. Donations pour in from his gullible supporters and now, his own fans are paying the legal fees   presumably for his son s scandal.Drip, drip, drip:The Trump campaign s FEC filing shows significant expenditures on legal representation as it wades through scrutiny involving alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. As part of that investigation, the FBI is examining whether the Trump campaign guided Russian disinformation efforts aimed at key voting precincts.The consulting firm owned by Brad Parscale, the former Trump campaign digital director at the center of that controversy, received more than $2 million in payments from the campaign in the second quarter.The name of the committee: Donald J.

334,"Sean Hannity threw a massive temper tantrum on Monday night in defense of Donald Trump.The Fox News host went off on a seriously delusional rant about Hillary Clinton, even referring to her as  President Clinton  on two occasions.Hannity whined about the indictments against Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, and just like Donald Trump, attempted to shift the focus from Trump s Russia collusion to Hillary Clinton. This is beyond insanity and it s inexcusable,  Hannity whined.  Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, the Obama Administration allowed your national security to be compromised in what is an unprecedented way and few in the media will touch this story. Major crimes were committed. They knew about it. They did nothing before the deal. Hannity is referring to the Uranium One deal the Obama Administration made with Russia back in 2010. Trump himself has been bellowing about it for quite some time now in a desperate effort to distract from his very real crimes.Basically, the deal gave a Russian company no more than a 51 percent stake in a Canadian-based mining company and ownership of  20 percent of the currently licensed uranium in-situ recovery production capacity in the U.S. This deal does not harm our national security as Hannity claims, nor did Hillary Clinton personally approve of the deal. Factcheck.org recently gave a run-down of the deal and thoroughly debunked Trump and Hannity s claims. As we ve written before, there is no evidence that donations to the Clinton Foundation from people with ties to Uranium One or Bill Clinton s speaking fee influenced Hillary Clinton s official actions,  FactCheck.org wrote.  That s still the case. In fact, not only did such a deal require approval from several federal agencies and committees, only 11 percent of overall U.S. production of uranium comes from Uranium One. And that uranium is sold to operators of commercial nuclear reactors. Basically, the uranium is being sold to us as it would have if Uranium One was not held by a Russian company. This deal was under a lot of scrutiny before it went through, and was even publicly announced. But Hannity did not utter one word about it when it happened.Of course, Hannity is still insisting that the evidence is on Trump s side despite the fact that there is a lot of evidence proving that he and Trump are full of shit and that Trump committed treason to steal an election. We are at a major crisis point in America tonight. Do we have equal justice under the law in this country today? If you or I or anybody in this room with me now or watching TV with you, if we ever did anything close to what the Clintons, the DNC, and others did, we would be rotting in a jail cell tonight hoping our friends would send us a cake that had a file. The only difference between Trump/Russia collusion is that we have the evidence, and after a year of black helicopter conspiracy theories, they have none. And just like we have the evidence, when it comes to Clinton and her email server scandal, why hasn t she been charged? Here s the video via YouTube.Hillary Clinton has not been charged because she didn t commit any crimes and there is ZERO evidence that she did. Trump, on the other hand, is about to go down for collusion.Clearly, nobody gives Trump a blowjob like Sean Hannity. And frankly, he and Fox News should be sued for slander.Featured Image: Screenshot",0
909,"James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence under President Barack Obama, appeared on CNN s Erin Burnett Out Front on Friday night, and he told Burnett just what many Americans have suspected since January. Speaking about Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign, Clapper told her that the intelligence community had met with Donald Trump prior to his inauguration. In that briefing, he and other intel chiefs discussed with Trump a joint assessment by the CIA, FBI, and NSA that concluded that the interference was significant enough to warrant concerns over the outcome of the election: Our intelligence community assessment did, I think, serve to cast doubt on the legitimacy of his victory in the election. Although Clapper didn t say it in the interview, the unspoken implication is that this message may have prompted Trump s ridiculous overreactions to his inaugural crowd size, the myth that millions of  illegals  voted in the election, and any number of other actions and statements that led to the creation of Trump s laughable  Commission on Election Integrity,  which has, thus far, served only as a vehicle for promoting voter suppression.Clapper s CNN appearance was timely. It came just a short while after Trump went back to his favorite outlet, Twitter, to vent his frustrations for the millionth time:The Russia hoax continues, now it's ads on Facebook. What about the totally biased and dishonest Media coverage in favor of Crooked Hillary?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 22, 2017Unfortunately for Trump, the fact is that the Facebook ads purchased by Russia weren t even part of that discussion with Clapper. Those weren t discovered until recently, after Facebook combed through their ad sales records and discovered hundreds of fake Russian profiles buying pro-Trump and pro-conservative ads on the social media platform during the campaign. That means that completely independent of any allegations about ad buying, the intelligence community had already concretely agreed that Russia helped Trump win the election.Even after the transition to Trump s administration and Cabinet, the investigation into Russian interference produced the same responses from different intel chiefs. When Senator Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, asked Trump s own CIA head and his new Director of National Intelligence whether they believed that Russian intelligence agencies were responsible for the hacks and leaks that led to the investigation, both Mike Pompeo and Dan Coats agreed.Clapper told Burnett that Trump s demeanor during the January briefing has been completely different than his behavior since he was inaugurated, calling the earlier Trump  solicitous, courteous, [and] even complimentary  when he sat down with the agencies.Trump is getting more than a little nervous now, and this interview with James Clapper sheds light on his renewed efforts to brush aside the Russia investigation.Watch:Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",0

625,"Here s a new low for America: During the unfolding tragedy in England, NBC announced that it would not be displaying the messages of Donald Trump, the President of the United States, because his tweets were spreading potential lies.Pres. Trump has used Twitter to share news report on London incident.We aren't relaying president's retweet, as the info is unconfirmed.  NBC Nightly News (@NBCNightlyNews) June 3, 2017Trump decided the minutes after a possible terror incident in London would be a good time to retweet fear-mongering speculation from the right-wing conspiracy site Drudge Report. His action may have done one of two equally disgusting things: He either amplified the terror being spread by a terror attack (thereby doing the work of the terrorist) or he spread misinformation and rumors thereby needlessly scaring people because of his eagerness to exploit a tragedy.Either way, people were appalled.But Trump wasn t done.Rather than wait for the facts to come in, Trump immediately seized on the moment to renew his push for a Muslim ban in the United States. British officials hadn t even confirmed the number of dead and wounded, and Trump was busy using the tragedy to promote his own bigoted policies an ocean away. It would take him three tweets before he got around to expressing concern for the victims.Trump has been increasingly relying on unreliable right-wing conspiracy sites to get his information. As president, he regularly receives extremely detailed information about world events from experts in the intelligence community, but his animosity towards the officials in the FBI and CIA, and his general dislike of reading makes him often ignore the valuable intel. Instead, he chooses to get his information from Drudge, Fox News, and InfoWars. The right-wing media sites are notoriously unscrupulous. InfoWars, for example, endorsed the theory that the Sandy Hook school shooting was staged by Obama as a pretext to taking people s guns. Drudge routinely gets facts wrong in its rush to promote fear and intolerance in its extremely right-wing audience.Two hours later, Trump finally deleted the Drudge Report tweet   which puts him in an awkward position because it technically violates federal law to do so. His advisers might want to tell him that the best way to avoid that is by not spreading Drudge Report tweets in the first place.Briefed by top National Security officials in the nation.Retweets Drudge.UnRetweets it.Unpresidented. pic.twitter.com/LhKqmD0zn2  Karen DaltonBeninato (@kbeninato) June 3, 2017Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",0

501,"Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has just sent the Trump campaign a message that is going to make them furious, especially coming from one of the largest investment banks in the country.Recently, the bank banned all of its top officials from donating to Trump s campaign   which is kind of hilarious considering how much Trump s campaign is struggling. In a memo right now, the bank instructed its highest ranking employees: Effective Thursday, September 1, all partners across the firm are considered  restricted persons  as defined by the firm s Policy on Personal Political Activities in the US. As outlined below, restricted persons are prohibited from engaging in political activities and/or making campaign contributions to candidates running for state and local offices, as well as sitting state and local officials running for federal office.The policy change is meant to prevent inadvertently violating pay-to-play rules, particularly the look-back provision, when partners transition into roles covered by these rules. The penalties for failing to comply with these rules can be severe and include fines and a ban on the firm from doing business with government clients in a particular jurisdiction for a period of at least two years.The policy change is also meant to minimize potential reputational damage caused by any false perception that the firm is attempting to circumvent pay-to-play rules, particularly given partners  seniority and visibility. All failures to pre-clear political activities as outlined below are taken seriously and violations may result in disciplinary action. Damn! And to make this even more brilliant, Goldman Sachs SPECIFICALLY called out the Trump campaign when they described the types of donations that are banned: any federal candidate who is a sitting state or local official (e.g., governor running for president or vice president, such as the Trump/Pence ticket, or mayor running for Congress), including their Political Action Committees (PACs). TwitterTwitterThe interesting thing here is that both Trump and Clinton s running mates hold a position in a political office   yet only Trump s VP pick, Indiana governor Mike Pence, is mentioned. To make matters even worse, these rules don t restrict donations to Clinton s campaign because Kaine is a U.S. Senator for Virginia and not considered a local official according to Goldman Sachs  rules (although the memo does say employees cannot donate to the Virginia Democratic party).Although Goldman Sachs  CEO hasn t officially said who he is voting for, it s public knowledge that he s a long-time Clinton fan, and had donated to her campaign when she ran against Obama in 2008.You can read the full memo here, as obtained by Fortune.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images",0
937,"Something strange happens when the President sees conspiracies everywhere: they tend to bleed into the rest of the government, at least the Republican government. Now, a crooked former GOP Congressman, who s best known for inviting Ted Nugent to President Obama s State of the Union speech, is blaming a Trump-touted conspiracy for the fact the he allegedly stole money for his campaign and personal use and got caught.Former Texas Rep. Steve Stockman blamed the  deep state  on his alleged campaign finance crimes, for which he was arrested. This is part of a deep state that s continuing to progress,  he said after a hearing. Stockman cited a right-wing conspiracy theory that the IRS targeted conservative groups.Stockman is being charged with diverting money from a charitable organization called Life Without Limits to his political campaign and for personal use. Beginning shortly after the $350,000 charitable donation was deposited into his Life Without Limits account, rather than spending the money on the  Freedom House,  Stockman secretly diverted the funds to pay for a variety of personal expenses and to fund illegal contributions to Stockman s campaigns for public office,  court documents filed with the criminal complaint stated.Source: RollcallSince Trump has taken office, we ve seen a lot about the supposed deep state. The deep state is, according to the Oxford Dictionary,  A body of people, typically influential members of government agencies or the military, believed to be involved in the secret manipulation or control of government policy.  Before Trump s election, the term was generally only used by fringe conspiracy theorists and white supremacists who accuse Jewish people of running a shadow government. Now, though, the head of the deep state could be Jewish, but he could also be Barack Obama. Conspiracy theories are fluid like that.Of course, Stockman has a history with the IRS. During the non-scandal scandal that involved the IRS daring to verify the veracity of non-profit statuses (from both sides of the aisle), he called for the arrest of IRS head at the time, Lois Lerner. It s looking more and more like his only reason for wanting Lerner s arrest was to prevent his arrest.Stockman has been released on bond and his main defense is that he stole only $15,000, not $350,000.Featured image via Gage Skidmore/Flickr",0

584,"Donald Trump practically does something to criticize the media as being  fake news  on an almost daily basis, but two major news networks have just turned the tables and put him on blast in a major way.The White House is currently up in arms over a recent decision by CNN and MSNBC, who decided not to air Trump s insanely dishonest North Dakota speech from earlier today. Trump was supposed to address tax reform in his speech, but there was a major problem with what he was saying   not a word of it was true. In response to this fact-free speech, CNN and MSNBC decided that it was irresponsible to air the speech and decided to spare Americans the misinformation and nonsense.Once the Trump administration found out about this move by the press, the White House practically threw a hissy fit. Special Assistant to the President and Assistant White House Communications Director Steven Chueng tweeted:Instead of insulting their viewers with Trump s lies, MSNBC s Nicole Wallace reported on important, truthful topics such as DACA and Russia. CNN s Jake Tapper focused on Hurricane Irma, Russia, and the debt ceiling while Trump spewed his usual nonsense.This was a major f*ck you to the Trump administration and sends a strong message that the dishonest narrative that his administration continues to put out to the American people will not be tolerated. While people aren t likely going to react so strongly to a topic as dry as tax reform, having two major networks refusing to air his speech is a big deal. Trump desperately wants and needs that coverage, and is obviously pissed that all eyes were not on him. If more cable news networks break from Trump, his already failing presidency will be in even more danger.Featured image is a screenshot",0
692,"A billionaire GOP donor is fed up with Donald Trump and he s fed up with Republicans in Congress who refuse to do anything about Trump. Now he has a very strongly worded message for Congress   he wants them to do something about the monster in the White House or he ll stop writing them checks. In fact, it might be too late.Florida Cuban-American billionaire Mike Fernandez is disgusted by Trump and in an interview posted on Thursday by Politico, he expressed (shall we say) frustration at Republicans who  balls  to impeach Trump. All the Republicans who hide behind the flag and hide behind the church, they don t have the f  balls to do what it takes,  Fernandez told POLITICO Florida in a telephone interview on Thursday.Fernandez has long been a huge supporter of Republicans, especially at the state level in Florida. He supported Mitt Romney, Florida Governor Rick Scott, Jeb Bush and several others, but he s no longer a Republican because of Trump. In 2016, he spent $3.5 million in an effort to defeat Trump. I am out of the political process. Too disgusted, too expensive, too supportive of ego maniacs whose words have the value of quicksand,  he wrote in an email to a Republican fundraiser seeking political contributions. It is demoralizing to me to see adults worshipping a false idol. I can t continue to write checks for anyone,  he said.  I know what it s like to lose a country. It gets worse. Fernandez called Trump one of the worst words in the English language   for forced-birth Republicans. He called Trump an  abortion of a human being. If I was the doctor and knew what that baby would do, I d have made sure it never would have seen the light of day,  he said of the president.The most interesting thing about all of this is that this might be what it takes for Republicans to wake up. Face it, they aren t going to grow a set of balls (to paraphrase Fernandez) any time in the near future, but they will be terrified of losing their donor base.Billionaires, more than anyone, care about how our country is perceived on the world stage. Chaos means market uncertainty, which is never a good thing for the moneyed class. If Trump continues down his current path, he will soon start losing the confidence of the GOP donor base. If Congress doesn t do something about him, look for all of the Trump sycophant members of Congress to be primaried, by the people who have all the money.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",0

718,"As President Obama is threatening and acting out on retaliation for Russia s hack of the United States election, it s becoming evident that the hack was even bigger. According to a report in the Washington Post, the Vermont electric utility was also hacked.While the Russians did not actively use the code to disrupt operations, according to officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a security matter, the discovery underlines the vulnerabilities of the nation s electrical grid. Officials in government and the utility industry regularly monitor the grid because it is highly computerized and any disruptions can have disastrous implications for the country s medical and emergency services.No one is sure at this point why the Russians hacked the small utility, but it s possible that they did it just to show us they can. It could also have been a test, similar to the way credit card thieves start with small charges to test the card.This is also far from out of character for Russia. Earlier in 2016, Russia allegedly hacked the power grid in the Ukraine.The hackers who struck the power centers in Ukraine the first confirmed hack to take down a power grid weren t opportunists who just happened upon the networks and launched an attack to test their abilities; according to new details from an extensive investigation into the hack, they were skilled and stealthy strategists who carefully planned their assault over many months, first doing reconnaissance to study the networks and siphon operator credentials, then launching a synchronized assault in a well-choreographed dance. It was brilliant,  says Robert M. Lee, who assisted in the investigation. Lee is a former cyber warfare operations officer for the US Air Force and is co-founder of Dragos Security, a critical infrastructure security company.  In terms of sophistication, most people always [focus on the] malware [that s used in an attack],  he says.  To me what makes sophistication is logistics and planning and operations and   what s going on during the length of it. And this was highly sophisticated. Source: WiredWhile Lee couldn t say for sure it was Russia, the Ukraine is convinced it was. Nonetheless, Lee said, it was a very well-funded operation and it could have been from a nation-state.As Wired notes, the electrical infrastructure in the Ukraine is more secure than it is overall in the United States. Beyond that, many of our electrical grids don t have backup, which means that it could be hours, days, or even longer before we get power back.Even more frightening, the entire nation could be without power indefinitely if just nine of its 55,000 substations were hit by terrorists or by hackers.A coordinated attack on just nine of the United States  55,000 electric-transmission substations on the right day could cause a blackout from Los Angeles to New York City, according to the study conducted by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The study s results have been known for months to select people in federal agencies, Congress and the White House, but were reported publicly for the first time Wednesday. The WSJ did not publish a list of the 30 most critical substations identified by the FERC study.One particularly troubling memo reviewed by the Journal described a scenario in which a highly-coordinated but relatively small scale attack could send the country into a long-term literal dark age.  Destroy nine interconnection substations and a transformer manufacturer and the entire United States grid would be down for at least 18 months, probably longer,  the memo said.Source: TimeOne of Donald Trump s campaign promises has been to improve the infrastructure. Obama has been trying to do that for most of his time in office, but Congress has blocked that. Still, even if Trump does get an infrastructure bill signed, his relationship with Russia is troubling. Will his loyalty be with the United States or is he indebted enough to Russia that he will leave the doors open for them to attack us where we are the most vulnerable? It s a disconcerting question, to say the least, and it s why the hacking of the election, along with Trump s praise of Putin, is a big f*cking deal.UPDATE: The Washington Post has issued a correction. The utility was hacked, but that Vermont utility is not corrected to the grid. An earlier version of this story incorrectly said that Russian hackers had penetrated the U.S. electric grid. Authorities say there is no indication of that so far. The computer at Burlington Electric that was hacked was not attached to the grid,  an editor s note attached to the original article said.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images",0

462,"Republican lawmakers come up with the most ridiculous things to push their agendas. Take women s reproductive rights. They have all manner of reasons for why abortion should be illegal; from the misogynistic, religious and moral reasons all the way over to the misogynistic and outright bizarre ones. A lawmaker in Wisconsin just tossed himself into the  misogynistic and outright bizarre  corner with the most ridiculous and offensive idea out there: Labor force shortages are tied to population declines. Labor force shortages are a limiting factor in economic growth. And limited economic growth poses a problem when government tries to pay for public services and infrastructure. In spite of this Mr. Speaker, ironically, the Democrats continue their effort to support the abortion industry. Yes, he really did essentially say that women should be forced to give birth, even to children they can t care for, to ensure a strong labor force and thus, a stronger economy.Holy hell, this is right up there with the guy from Oklahoma who said that hormonal contraception litters women s uteruses with tiny, dead babies. How do people come up with this bullshit? And they manage to make it sound completely reasonable when they do it. Watch this guy try to sound all reasonable about it below:WOW. WI Rep.

1202,"Jay Dyer 21st Century WireAs the recent events (and subsequent incoherent media narratives) in Dallas continue to unravel, familiar patterns have already emerged that once again paint a now familiar picture of large-scale planning. We are now expected to believe this highly coordinated, professional  sniper  operation, whose numbers and details have now significantly changed, were conducted by the likes of a former vet and unknown accomplices for the purposes of targeting  white people,  and in particular, police.The new Judge Dredd-style execution by Robot! Doesn t this all sound like a scripted move?Immediately given the symbolic title  Michael X to affiliate the suspect with Malcolm X, the entire scenario, from the revised proclamation of cell terrorist to  lone wolf,  now smells of sub-par Hollywood script-writing   especially the ludicrous climax of  hidden IEDs  followed by police deploying a bomb-carrying Robocop R2D2-like executioner as the only rational means of finally halting the crazed assassin.As we will see, the event also echoes prior known false flags and staged scenarios, as well as fitting a general pattern of Soros-style color revolutions and agitation propaganda, on top of the fact that the evolving official story is preposterous.While it may appear contradictory at first glance, the notion that such an event could fit the  progressive  mold of a color revolution is not far-fetched.Consortium News details numerous Soros-funded groups that have called for soft-power coups and regime changes through numerous fronts that include  social justice  causes, as well as right-wing groups like  Right Sektor  in the Ukraine. 21stCenturyWire comments: Amazingly, by late last night and early this morning, police Chief David Brown reported that at least 3 of suspected snipers were already in custody.Brown stated early on that he believed the four suspects were working as a unit, using long-range rifles,  triangulated at elevated positions at difference places in the downtown area. The fourth suspect, Micah Xavier Johnson (the media referred to him as Micah X to intentionally prompt a Malcolm X tone to the event) a military-trained marksman and US Army veteran was said to be caught in a shoot-out with police from the second floor of the El Centro parking garage. He was upset about Black Lives Matter, the recent police shootings, he was upset at white people. He wanted to kill white people, especially police officers,  Brown said. (NY Post)  Bizarrely, according to police, Johnson (photo, above) was finally summarily executed by police after an unprecedented  risk assessment  by the Dallas police   who deployed a robot carrying a bomb. Chief Brown claimed that his officers  had no choice  but to use the bomb to kill the suspect:  Other options would have exposed our officers to grave danger. The political ripple effects of this unlikely and highly improbable event were felt immediately, as the mainstream media siege was underway, and the politicians began lining up to weigh-in and jockey for political position on any number of issue ranging from gun control, to race relations, and police brutality, but also debating the whether or not public marches and demonstrations are indeed safe for the public to attend in the face of this latest  security threat. On the police side of this dialectic, law enforcement are also queuing up to decry the violence against police and calls are omnipresent for increased police powers and security measure in order to  combat the rising threat of domestic extremism. Coincidentally, yesterday s event just happened to all on July 7th, or  7/7 ala London 7/7.  Following on that theme, the media and law enforcement began floating the term  terrorist attack  and CNN leading the pack by claiming that Dallas 7/7 was the police s  worst loss since  9/11  (Sept 11, 2001). So one can see how the spin is already being applied to this media event. Hollywood dramas that go live!Ukraine is of particular significance given the similarities between the false flag scenario of the Maidan sniper and the 7/7 purported racially-motivated event in Dallas. For both Right Sektor s Ukrainian Nationalists and Black Lives Matter s Alinsky-style Revolutionary there is a similar modus operandi of background financing and manipulation. In a piece I authored last year, I compared these similar tactics and discussed the think tank and  soft power  meta-strategy involved in geopolitical re-engineering, both domestically and abroad.Keep in mind that according to even mainstream fixture The New York Times most  terror plots  are hatched and aided by the FBI. The Soros-style NGO and soft power approach has seen the aiding of both far left and far right with the overall intent of duping progressives into war.  I wrote concerning NGOs and think tanks identity politics  and radicalization, an international operation for  change  being engineered out of New York: In the case of black youth, the Occupy-style thug culture of hip hop and rap easily combines with the radical Jihadism of intelligence agency creations like ISIS.  Both groups share a similar sense of being oppressed minorities, and both are utilized as foolish dupes of the same western establishment, dancing according to the whims of their foundation puppeteer masters.In case you were wondering, this is how the foundations and think tanks provoke minority groups with similar, but rebranded ideologies of invented revolution, particularly through the mainstream (and alternative) news cycle s scientifically precise emotionally manipulative stories that are intentionally chosen, crafted, cropped and created for the foundation/think tank revolutionary agenda.Patsies and provocateurs.This same technique is now being used for gender as a whole, as feminism,  women s rights,   gender rights,  equality, etc., now make up a large portion of the total news feed.  Increasingly taking on a clickbait style, the endless gender oppression articles are another technology for social re-engineering under the guise of appealing to the female populace.Females are undeniably more susceptible to emotional appeals and advertising deception, the same marketing styles of ad campaigns for endless hygiene products now mirrors the mindless, gender-based  stories  of oppressed trans teens and eternally victimized and  oppressed  western women (who have the highest living standards in the world).  While western women conduct their war on the patriarchal power by sharing these retarded stories on their iPads, they are just as much the dupes of the same foundation/think tank techniques as the low IQ ISIS  recruits  and the ghetto mobs.On the other side of the dialectic are the equally duped  right wingers  who still champion the Bush Dynasty and so-called American  freedoms,  the great envy of all the world that must be protected at all costs from an absolutely impossible, fabricated foreign invasion by ISIS. Constituting the new boogey-man in the patriot/tea party mythos, the invasion of the western intelligence created and backed  ISIS  is the phony  bad man  parallels the phony bad man  of the thugs (the 1%, which is actually anyone middle class), and the bad man  of the narcissistic American female, the patriarchy.All of these  bad men  are invented bad men, manufactured and created by the foundations and think tanks to manipulate your specific population niche.  The establishment has recruited and used dumb, low IQ, prison-convert, Muslim mind-controlled bots for decades, just as the system has used dumb, low IQ females as poster children for  gender revolution. The  Sniper  Effect Unknown Snipers  are a classic tactic of Western-influenced regime changes, including Romania in 1989 in regard to Ceaucescu, which is particularly relevant to our situation, as the coup there involved a revolt against police.  Sniper death squads in Romania aided by western intelligence would thus be a perfect parallel to anti-police engineered  sniping  in Dallas.Other events where snipers were involved in regime change and staged agitprop include the  Arab Spring,  Yeltsin s counter-government in 1993, Venezuela in 2002, Thailand in 2010, and more recently, Kyrgyzstan, Egypt, Libya and Syria.  Supposed unknown snipers, like terrorists, provide a useful function for existing regimes or foreign powers to conveniently concoct and steer events by pinning blame on patsies.Same strategy of controlled, radical opposition in a game of obvious dialectics.Like Operation Gladio where from the 50s to the 80s, left-wing  radicals  were blamed for Euro-terror completely engineered and staged by a covert branch of NATO intelligence and P-2 affiliated masonry lodge, similar patterns are seen in today s  terror cells  and  lone wolf shooters.  Some wondered why I originally mentioned the masonic apparel in the original post, but this is because Gladio used P-2 and secret societies can function as networks for organizing and arranging provocateurs, much like the Muslim Brotherhood or ISIS.  In short, sniping events, just like  false flags,  are run by and advantageous to the state, not lone wolves and terror cells.Indeed, it is the same pattern mentioned above domestically, with the FBI-hatched terror plots. Terror in these instances functions to exacerbate a  strategy of tension  to smear opposition, promote undue fear, and cajole the populace into accepting more surveillance and security theater.  Dallas saw a similarly implausible story last year of  conspiracy theorist  James Boulware, a  lone wolf shooter  who purportedly shot at police after incoherent online ramblings (which are quite clearly manufactured), and now we are told Micah X has a  manifesto    a must have for your daily shooter starter pack.Highly dubious James Boulware Dallas  Shooting Fusion  DrillsAs noted in my original video, at least two large-scale, multi-agency DHS supervised  fusion  drills in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area preceded the 7/7 event by only a week.  One drill even included  three shooters and bombs,  a narrative now fed into the mainstream media concerning the Dallas sniping event. Given every major terror event of recent recollection has been preceded by a drill of the same scenario, it should be obvious to question the Dallas event, as it fits the same patterns as prior  terror. The familiar narrative of Dallas now includes  IEDs  hidden in mysterious locales, a dubious claim inserted into the narrative of James Holmes   booby-trapped  apartment, for example.  The date and locale for the event is also suspicious, being in the vicinity of the JFK assassination as well as on the anniversary of the London 7/7 bombing, another staged event.We are supposed to believe  Micah X  learned his sniping and IED skills in the military and subsequently coordinated a professional hit man operation to target random white police over the shootings of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling that occurred that day!  Mass media claimed the supposed shooter was angry about events that transpired that day, and subsequently had time to perform reconnaissance and establish sniper spots for that day s Black Lives Matter Protest.Lunacy does not end there, as the standoff with police then involved the preposterous claim of utilizing and  bomb-bot  to blow the suspect up, as he supposedly refused to cooperate.  Are bomb-bots now standard procedure?  Were the mainstream narrative of this event true (and it certainly is not), wouldn t law enforcement choose to gas the subject or subdue him, to gather information about his so-called terror cell?  Instead, the public was fed a fantastical Robocop storyline to add tabloid juice to this manufactured event, as we have seen in so many.Patsies, dupes and provocateurs. Black power  groups are notorious for being infiltrated by federal agents and provocateurs, and the New Black Panther Party is a shining example.  Allowed to consistently call for the death of all whites (which is illegal), this fake front group is allowed to continue to agitate and play on public fears, like other  terror groups  and racial identity movements.  Like the KKK or Elohim City and McVeigh, the black power and Nation of Islam movements have been exposed as phony government fronts many times, often identified by their outlandish and outrageous calls for violence.Most famously, this was seen in the COINTELPRO operation, with FBI informant Richard Aoki arming the Black Panthers to make them appear distastefully radical.Photo-op. Patty Hearst and the theatrical SLA  abduction. The Saul Alinsky-style approach of manufacturing radicals for self-destructive social  change  that marks this event also has precedent in two other previously contrived  terror  attacks: The Alinsky-inspired Bill Ayers Weather Underground event, and Patty Hearst SLA staging.  Both events were manufactured operations that served to solidify mass opinion against anti-war movements, while the SLA event (in which reportedly 6 died, while Patty Hearst was not even in the building) became the basis for America s adoption of SWAT teams   the Hearst soap opera kidnapping was even followed by a television show called  SWAT  that aided in the rise of America s acceptance of the  Warrior Cop. This fact, as well as the long-term federalization of local police refutes the faux right-wing narrative that Obama and company are  anti-cop. Seen in this light, the Dallas event is ably summed up in its effectiveness for the establishment by Patrick Henningsen: The Dallas Shooting is significant on a number of levels.Firstly, Dallas will further accentuate the artificial divide between what Americans perceive as the  Left  or liberal wing of political society, and the what is sold as America s  Right  or conservative wing. In this dialectic, Democrat is set against Republican, young against old, black is pitted against white, wealthy against poor, upper class against middle class, and even middle class against lower class. In the run-up to the Presidential election in November, this division will be important in order to polarize America along a prefabricated dialectical line and thus keeping the national discourse down at a base, or emotional level   and through this binary process avoid any real examination of America s fundamental issues, policy flaws and the federal government s unsustainable bloated borrow & spend habit   effectively kicking the can down the road another 4 years (which seems to be the norm). Ultimately, this serves the state, its bureaucratic stakeholders and the power structure as a whole. Secondly, this event can be used to nudge the  left-wing  and Democrat party s own gun control agenda, which is being aggressively pursued at the moment. This wing of the political establishment has already demonstrated that it has no qualms about using a national incident or tragedy, like the Orlando Shooting, as warm PR leverage to push their  emergency  legislative agenda. Ironically,  left-wing  and black activists will be blamed for this latest act of political violence and will be used in this case to further advance the political left s own bespoke gun control agenda   much to the dismay of  Conservative America. As a result of this staged event carried out by agent provocateurs,  anti-police  or  anti-government  African-American  militant , or  Black Power  activists will be painted a poor light, and effectively marginalized. Once this process is complete, the state can then move in to extend that marginalization to any anti-government  protests   further neutering any real grass-roots opposition for what is obviously a rapidly growing police state in the US.Thirdly, this event is being used to increase tension between the public and law enforcement. Note the differences between the short and the long-term narratives at play here. In the short-term, this Dallas Sniper event is originally designed as a  reaction  to US police killing poor unarmed black men on the streets of America, but in the long-term the pendulum will swing back to the state in order to  restore law and order , thus further consolidating power into a more concentrated police state. This is evidenced already by US law enforcement are already rallying in solidarity, in an us against them dialectic by placing the nation s police as the protagonist and the public as the antagonist. Pop culture promotion of supposed anti-establishment agitation and  revolution.  In reality, it is top-down social engineering and psychological warfare.Given the government admission that much of modern history has been manipulated and contrived through false flags and staged events, is it sensible to take the Dallas event at face value?  We are constantly reminded in every terror  event to  never forget  9/11, but a much more apt recollection would be to never forget the admissions and examples of fake and staged news, as well as individuals who supposedly die in three separate  terror  events being still alive show the lunacy of the fact there is no law or regulation upon the government and private infotainment news agencies barring them from manufacturing events.  Rather, the pattern 21Wire recognized and exposed in the recent Andrews Air Force Base s phony  live shooter  drill-gone-live scenario serves as the exemplary form of how these events are engineered   especially given the drills preceding the 7/7 Dallas event.Naturally, the  alt right  will seize upon the event as proof of a racial attack, but this simply plays into the establishment s desire for a helter skelter  race war and a  summer of chaos,  all of which was prepared for symbolically through Beyonc s militant  Black Panther  Super Bowl Halftime Show back in February.  The  race war  is not fought with bats and maces in the streets, but through the toxic culture itself with its insidious programming for each racial group.As we have seen in past events,  gun control  is once again the unanimous cacophony, while the labeling of  Black Lives Matter  as a  terrorist  group only serves to set further precedence for anyone critical of the establishment as an  extremist  or  terrorist.

67,"Donald Trump s lewd comments about sexually assaulting women in a 2005 leaked audio tape are wreaking havoc on his presidential campaign. Not only are prominent Republicans distancing themselves from him, but even his own running mate, Mike Pence, looks like he s about to jump ship.First, Pence pulled out of a Wisconsin rally, where Donald Trump said Pence would be taking the place of House Speaker Paul Ryan, who also canceled following the tape s release. Now, Pence has canceled a New Jersey fundraiser for Trump that was supposed to take place today   signaling a trend of upcoming disruptions in Trump s campaign schedule. There were supposed to be 250 people at this event, who all paid $50 to attend.This isn t surprising, considering how strongly Pence opposed Trump s disrespectful, misogynistic comments in the 2005 recording. Trump s running mate released a statement that said: As a husband and father, I was offended by the words and actions described by Donald Trump in the eleven-year-old video released yesterday. I do not condone his remarks and cannot defend them. This cancellation is even more questionable considering that on Trump s campaign website, a message showed that all Mike Pence events had been canceled:Trump website The site was later updated with two new events for today   in North Carolina instead of New Jersey   but this is certainly a strange move for a campaign. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks has not yet returned comment on whether Pence would actually be attending the North Carolina events   we wouldn t be surprised if he skipped those, too.It could very well be that Trump s degrading, rape-like comments about how he interacts with women were the final straw for the Republican party, and the final straw for Pence. It s bad enough that Pence and Trump have previously disagreed on several policies and issues   but now it seems that Trump has crossed the line and Pence can t stand to represent him any longer.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images",0

In MALDEF s view, supporters of making English the official language of the United States are  motivated by racism and anti-immigrant sentiments,  while advocates of sanctions against employers reliant on illegal labor seek to discriminate against  brown-skinned people.

229,"In the aftermath of the historic flooding that accompanied Hurricane Harvey s high winds and torrential rains, there was a surprising effect on the Arkema chemical plant east of Houston on Greens Bayou. The facility was inundated with so much water that it lost power, and that s when the chemical reactions began. When stored at improper temperatures, the organic peroxides at Arkema are unstable, leading to  popping  sounds, smoke, and eventually fire.Those fires emitted a smoke that many in the area described differently. Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said the emissions were like standing over a barbecue pit or something like that, where you get smoke in your eyes,  according to NBC News. Richard Rennard, a representative of Arkema, described what came from the plant a little more cautiously:[The emissions are] noxious, certainly. I don t know the composition of the smoke.A deputy was, in fact, taken to the hospital after inhaling the fumes coming from the plant.But after officials warned everyone in a nearly two-mile radius that more explosions could follow, questions about whether the plant was following proper safety protocols began to arise. That s when Arkema s connection to the Trump EPA came to light.The International Business Times got their hands on federal records that showed Arkema successfully lobbied EPA Chief Scott Pruitt and a number of Republicans in an effort to delay new safety regulations for chemical plants that were passed by the Obama administration. Those rules, crafted after the chemical plant disaster in West, Texas 200 miles from Houston, would have taken effect in March. They also would have directly affected Arkema.In their letter opposing the new regulations, Arkema used standard conservative trope: That the rules would  likely add significant new costs and burdens to the corporate audit process.  Those costs, of course, would be on top of the more than $90,000 in OSHA fines assessed to the Crosby Arkema plant this year alone, all for  serious  violations. But it was nonetheless Arkema s conclusion that  the final rule includes a litany of costly changes that have not been shown to increase safety. That seems a little less than true at this point.Although Texas Governor Greg Abbott has blocked public access to state records of just what chemicals are stored in which facilities, the AP reported that the Arkema plant also housed sulfur dioxide and methylpropen, which are, respectively, toxic and flammable. Storage of these chemicals would have required Arkema to file a risk management plan with the EPA   which would have triggered the new Obama-era rules.If Trump hadn t struck them down, that is.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",0

1069,"Apparently, original ideas are a liability in the Donald Trump administration. Nearly as many Trumpsters have been accused of plagiarism as weeks he s held in office. Okay, that s a slight exaggeration, but Neil Gorsuch, the man who s about to be rammed into a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court, appears to have plagiarized some of his writing.We should have known when Trump s own wife Melania plagiarized part of her Republican National Convention speech from Michelle Obama.Once in office, Trump picked Monica Crowley to head the National Security Council. You got it, she plagiarized her Ph.D. dissertation and the book she published in 2012.Crowley was forced to drop out of contention, but Betsy DeVos is Trump s education secretary and in a move that would get a child kicked out of school, she plagiarized part of the questionnaire she filled out to get the job. Now, it appears, Trump s pick for the Supreme Court is also guilty of plagiarism.Politico obtained several documents that showed several passages of Gorsuch s 2006 book,  The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia,  were nearly identical to a 1984 article in the Indiana Law Journal. There were also several other incidents.In the most striking example, Gorsuch, in his book, appears to duplicate sentences from an Indiana Law Journal article written by Abigail Lawlis Kuzma without attributing her. Instead, he uses the same sources that Kuzma used: A 1982 Indiana court ruling that was later sealed, a well-known pediatrics textbook,  Rudolph s Pediatrics,  and a 1983 article in the Bloomington Sunday Herald.Politico reports on documents showing that SCOTUS nominee Neil Gorsuch plagiarized the work of others. Behold: https://t.co/XQnCmd62Ia pic.twitter.com/ooc2TkG2bA  Christina Wilkie (@christinawilkie) April 5, 2017There s more. Read the Politico article for all the instances.The White House is calling the accusations false: This false attack has been strongly refuted by highly-regarded academic experts, including those who reviewed, professionally examined, and edited Judge Gorsuch s scholarly writings, and even the author of the main piece cited in the false attack,  said White House spokesman Steven Cheung.  There is only one explanation for this baseless, last-second smear of Judge Gorsuch: those desperate to justify the unprecedented filibuster of a well-qualified and mainstream nominee to the Supreme Court. Experts disagree with the White House: Each of the individual incidents constitutes a violation of academic ethics. I ve never seen a college plagiarism code that this would not be in violation of,  said Rebecca Moore Howard, a Syracuse University professor who has written extensively on the issue.Not that it should make much of a difference.

287,"A firefighter in Ohio recently came under fire for expressing his  economic uncertainty  (a synonym the media concocted for  racism  while attempting to explain why people voted for Trump) about rescuing black people.If it came down to choosing to rescue a single dog or  a million n*ggers,  Franklin township firefighter Tyler Roysdon says he would save the dog, which is  more important than  all those African-Americans he hates.According to Roysdon s Facebook  likes,  he is a fan of Donald Trump, Duck Dynasty, and far-Right Facebook group  Uncle Sam s Misguided Children    just so you know what sort of person we re dealing with.Roysdon was suspended from his position  indefinitely  as soon as township officials learned of the post, which went viral on social media because that s what happens when terrible people say terrible things. It s also very likely he will lose his job according to a statement from officials: Recently, a Franklin Township volunteer firefighter posted unacceptable remarks on social media.  Upon gaining knowledge of this information, Fire Chief Steve Bishop immediately contacted the firefighter and directed the comments be removed.  The firefighter was suspended without pay until the Board of Township Trustees could meet to determine a course of action.  Chief Bishop does not have the authority to terminate employees.  Termination of any township employee requires a vote by the Board of Trustees. It s unclear if Roysdon s racism has ever affected his work or if he has caused anyone to die, but this is absolutely something that should be investigated.Featured image via screengrab",0

1014,"While Trump crows about all the unscientific, self-selecting online polls that were rigged by his followers, the scientific polls with credibility are telling a very different post-debate story. One particular poll, which NBC conducted starting from the end of the debate on Sept. 26 into Sept. 27, shows Trump did so poorly that more people said neither candidate won than said Trump won.According to that poll, 52 percent of likely voters said Hillary won. 21 percent said Trump won, and 26 percent said neither candidate won.Image via NBC NewsOuch. Ouch ouch ouch. For someone who was only able to speak for 38 percent of the time, compared to Trump s 62 percent (and constant  Just shut up because I am God  interruptions), poll numbers like that are pretty astonishing.It s about as bad as when candidates finish worse than  none of these candidates  at the ballot box. Basically, there is nobody except the Trumpkins who believes Trump did anything of value Monday night. Furthermore, just 26 percent of Republican respondents said that the debate changed their opinion of Trump for the better. That s a pretty sorry number compared to 50 percent of Democratic respondents saying their opinion of Hillary changed for the better.Some Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill were disappointed in Trump and his performance, too. They wanted him to attack Hillary over the dead horse of an email scandal they re so sure makes her unfit to lead the country, and he didn t. Others, however, were frustrated with his inability to put forth succinct talking points: I wish that he d say something, stick with it, and then move on to something else instead of saying the same thing over and over and over,  [Arizona Rep. Matt] Salmon said in an interview Tuesday without giving specific examples.  It was just throughout the entire debate.' Anyone who tries to read a complete transcript of the debate will have the same frustration, if not worse. Trump literally cannot stick to the point, rambles on, talks in circles, etc., and Hillary wiped the floor with him in part because of that. The rest of it   well, she s eminently qualified and he isn t, and she proved it.The NBC poll was conducted online among a sample of 7,541 likely voters, culled from the 3 million adults who take surveys on SurveyMonkey every day. The margin of error is 1.6 percent, so Trump isn t even tied with  neither,  for second place. He finished dead last.Featured image by Drew Angerer/Getty Images",0
923,"The Democratic ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee dropped a bombshell Wednesday afternoon when he revealed that there is  more than circumstantial evidence now  of collusion between Donald Trump and Russia.Speaking to MSNBC s Chuck Todd, Rep. Adam Schiff said the evidence that Trump s team colluded with Russia is no longer just circumstantial. On Sunday, Schiff said that there was circumstantial evidence of collusion and direct evidence  of deception, but today, he said there is more.When Todd asked him if the case for collusion was only circumstantial, Schiff said, I can tell you that the case is more than that. I can t go in to the particulars but there is more than circumstantial evidence now,  Schiff said. You have seen direct evidence of collusion?  Todd asked. I don t want to go into specifics but I will say that there is evidence that is not circumstantial and very much worthy of investigation  Schiff said.This is the furthest a lawmaker has gone regarding proof that Trump was working with Russia to cheat his way into the White House.On Monday, during a hearing before the House Intelligence Committee, FBI Director James Comey publicly confirmed that the bureau is investigation both Russia s interference in the election and the possibility that Trump was in cahoots with Putin the whole time. Comey also testified that this investigation began way back in July of 2016.You can watch Schiff s interview here:Featured image via video screen capture",0
361,"Every American needs to consider this new evidence about Hillary and how her campaign is helping to hide her poor health from voters unless of course, the only reason you re planning to vote for Hillary is because you like her VP candidate, Tim Kaine Why does Hillary reject a bottle of water for a glass of water during her coughing fit in front of press on her new campaign plane? Why does Hillary have a stool and GLASS OF WATER next to her at all times during public appearances? Why does Hillary tell press she s suffering from allergies when allergens aren t even high in the specific region where she s speaking? Why is Hillary resting while Donald Trump is out running circles around her on the campaign trail? Why does the media cover for her lies and MOST IMPORTANTLY, why is anyone supporting this woman who is clearly not well enough to even campaign for the highest office in our nation???During the Republican National Convention last June, two Secret Service agents approached InfoWars and asked to speak to them about Hillary s health. The Secret Service contacted me. They said that Hillary Clinton has Parkinson s disease. They [Hillary s people] spent over a quarter million dollars on these stairs to allow her to step down from the vehicle to the ground because she has trouble walking. They [Secret Service] said that any kind of flashes or strobes will set her off into a seizure, and that s why they wanted to come us.They wanted to contact us and give us information because they knew we [InforWars] would be able to get this out. [Unlike the MSM,] we wouldn t be scared to do it. And you know it really makes a lot of sense when you watch all these videos. The fact that she s refusing to do these news conferences. Hillary had not done a press conference for 8  months. Her last press conference was on December 4, 2015.DOES HILLARY HAVE PARKINSON S DISEASE?As a neurological disorder, Parkinson s disease (PD) has been shown to affect motor skills in the limbs, inhibit muscle coordination, and sometimes contribute to dysphagia.1   Dysphagia is the medical term for difficulty swallowing. Thickened liquids are often used in the management of dysphagia to improve bolus control and to help prevent aspiration. A range of starches and gums has historically been used to thicken liquids. Although thickened liquids improve swallow safety, they appear to have a great potential for unintended physiological consequences.Like this  unintended physiological consequence  maybe?  Why does Hillary always have a stool and GLASS OF WATER at every public appearance? Don t most people in this day and age drink from a bottle of water?Again the stool and the GLASS OF WATER And again On Feb. 4, WND reported Hillary Clinton has been prescribed Armour Thyroid, a natural medication made from desiccated pig thyroid glands, for her hypothyroid condition and Coumadin   a brand name of warfarin, which initially was developed as a well-known rat poison   for her congenital tendency to form blood clots.WND also reported the medication Clinton has taken since 1998 to deal with her blood-clotting problems may have side effects that are hazardous to her health, including blurred vision and confusion, both of which she has experienced. And a California physician warned Coumadin could be more life-threatening to her than the possibility of a recurring blood clot.Bill Clinton, during a question and answer session at the Peterson Foundation in Washington, on May 14, 2014, told the audience that the concussion Hillary suffered  required six months of very serious work to get over. On Nov. 16, 2015, in an exchange between Hillary Clinton s aides Huma Abedin and Monica Hanley dated Jan. 26, 2013, regarding Clinton s schedule, the aides said it was  very important  to go over phone calls with Clinton because the former secretary of state was  often confused. Clinton s five-minute bathroom break at the third Democratic debate in Goffstown, New Hampshire, on Dec. 19, 2015, initially attributed to the distance of the woman s bathroom from the stage, was reported to have caused a  flare up of problems from brain injury  that required Clinton to sit in a chair off-stage to recover from fatigue, dizziness and disorientation.WND just last week reported that at least 10 prominent physicians have been questioning Hillary Clinton s health.Based on publicly available information, the following physicians have raised concerns:  Dr. Jane Orient, M.D., executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, said images of Clinton being helped up stairs and propped up, and videos showing odd, seizure-like head movements require an explanation to voters, she contends. The author of  Emerging Diseases: Protecting Your Family from Pandemics, Viral Threats, and Rogue Vaccines  noted the  vituperation and anger  that she s faced for raising questions.  I m not making a diagnosis,  she told WND on Monday. But  I can look at the video. You can look. She said for a medical professional to simply ignore the evidence would be  completely reckless.  Meeting someone with these symptoms personally would require a  How are you?  she said.  These are not ridiculous questions.  Dr. Lee Hieb, author of  Surviving the Medical Meltdown: Your Guide to Living Through the Disaster of Obamacare,  agreed.  They made a huge deal about [Sen. John] McCain because of his melanoma,  she told WND.  Melanoma doesn t give you dementia!  She said the images and videos are evidence that should be reviewed and explained to voters, contending Clinton is  not being forthcoming. If she doesn t want the American people informed   we know where she stands. Citing Clinton s previous concussion, Hieb said such injuries can cause long-term side effects, seizures, personality changes and cognitive deficits.  The Fox News medical  A-Team  of Dr. Marc Siegel and Dr. David Samadi had questions.  In 2008   I looked over a thousand pages of John McCain s records because of a melanoma he had 10 years ago. What about Hillary? In 2009, a severe fall. She breaks her elbow. In 2011, she boards a plane, falls. In 2012, she has a severe concussion which Bill Clinton says took her six months to recover from,  Siegel said. He continued:  Then she ends up with a blood clot in the brain and a lifetime of blood thinners. Just that point alone   if she s prone to falling, you can see from that picture up there that it looked like she can barely get upstairs without two people carrying her. Guess what if she falls and hits her head? She ll get a blood clot.  Dr. Drew Pinsky s television show on the HLN cable network,  Dr. Drew on Call,  was canceled after he raised questions about Clinton s health in an interview on KABC-AM in Los Angeles. Alt-Right fanatics and conspiracy theorists  immediately questioned her health   is she ok? And concerns over Hillary s  worst coughing fit ever  was raised by MSNBC.But as Paul Josepth Watson reports, MSNBC regurgitated claims by Hillary s campaign aides that,  Allergens were high in Northeast Ohio on Monday,  before asserting that there is  no evidence to indicate she is unwell.

What about the 10 previous times? pic.twitter.com/lwDNYjhEhI  Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) September 5, 2016The problem for that propadandist line is   It was a complete fabrication.As numerous websites that track daily allergen levels confirmed, grass pollen was low, tree pollen was low and ragweed pollen was moderate.

323,"People like to pretend that Mike Pence is the grown-up in the room compared to Donald Trump s brash childishness from the White House. However, he proved that wrong on Sunday, when he left the Indiana Colts football game because a few of the players on the team opposing the Colts chose to take a knee during the national anthem to protest police brutality against black and brown Americans. Taking a leaf out of Trump s playbook, Pence tweeted:I left today's Colts game because @POTUS and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem.  Vice President Pence (@VP) October 8, 2017While everyone is entitled to their own opinions, I don't think it's too much to ask NFL players to respect the Flag and our National Anthem  Vice President Pence (@VP) October 8, 2017Just like Trump, Pence forgets the meaning of the First Amendment, and seems to think that his position gives him the right to try to bully owners, players, and ultimately the National Football League into following his orders. Further, it is worth noting that the Colts were playing the San Francisco 49ers, which is the former team of Colin Kaepernick, the man who started this protest before being blacklisted from the NFL for taking a stand against police brutality against people of color. Further, Pence and Trump admitted that they used the situation to divide the country and make some kind of point on the taxpayers  dime   because of course we paid for Pence to travel to that football game. For one thing, the press was kept in the van, in anticipation of Pence stirring the pot and then leaving:The media pool was kept in the vans ahead of the game instead of being led in with VPOTUS. https://t.co/NXIFZCp3fb  Vaughn Hillyard (@VaughnHillyard) October 8, 2017FLAG: Was Pence leaving Colts game a political stunt?

926,"It seems like a lifetime since March 23rd, 2010. But thanks to a pretty significant bill signed that day, at least there are no lifetime caps on your health insurance anymore. In fact, there were so many rules and regulations inside Obamacare that benefited consumers instead of insurers that the GOP went absolutely insane trying to undo them. That s no small wonder: Insurance companies gave Republican candidates and conservative groups nearly 37 million dollars in the last election cycle of 2015-16 alone.But the one thing Obamacare didn t do  couldn t do   was clamp down on premiums. Not without changing the way the entire industry is regulated. The fact is, premiums have been skyrocketing for a long time, and for a simple reason. Insurance companies know you need them more than they need you. In other words, because they can. But an interesting thing happened after the ACA was signed: The rising cost of premiums slowed to less than half the growth rate they were undergoing during the Bush years. Why? Because more people were getting insured.Republicans point to raw numbers and call it an increase that happened under Obama. But the premium increase from 2010 to 2016 was much, much smaller than it would have been without the changes to the system that Obamacare wrought. What will they point to now that premiums are on a fast track again? They won t point to Republican policy or Donald Trump. But I will.The Kaiser Family Foundation, a non-partisan, non-profit health care think tank, has been studying premium growth for nearly 20 years. In fact, if you ve ever read stats on health care   who s insured, median cost, what might happen if various bills were passed   you were likely looking at KFF data. And according to their latest study, there s a definitive reason that premiums are going up at the rate they re back to: Because Donald Trump is sabotaging the ACA.Trump s constant description of Obamacare as  failing  is already unhelpful. But his threats to stop cost-sharing subsidy payments are worse. And even worse than that, his persistent badgering of the GOP Congress to repeal Obamacare entirely   even without a replacement plan   has insurance companies scrambling to figure out how to stay in business. If Donald Trump got his way, after all, the number of people without health insurance in America would double in a very short time. And if you don t have insurance, they don t have a customer.So what s the effect of Trump s sabotage? Premiums are about to go through the roof. Just by threatening to stop enforcing the individual mandate   the mechanism that makes Obamacare even work   Trump has caused insurers to request rate increases from regulators anywhere from 1.2 percent to 20 percent. And his threats to stop cost-sharing payments bumps that startling figure up to 23 percent.For years, Republicans liked to point to any increase in premiums as the fault of Obamacare. But premium growth slowed as America got used to the idea of a larger risk pool, and it hasn t started under Obama in the first place. Now we can point directly to the actions of Donald Trump as the reason premiums are once again on the rise.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",0

661,"He may work for Fox Radio but this man deserves a ton of respect for what he just did. At a breaking point with Trump s love affair with the racist blog  The Gateway Pundit,  Fox Radio s Jon Decker openly and vehemently criticized the White House for allowing the website, which panders in fake right-wing conspiracies and racist rhetoric, to attend daily press briefings alongside legitimate news sources.Decker didn t hold back. Pointing directly at The Gateway Pundit s Lucian Wintrich, Decker noted that he and his site  hate blacks, Jews, [and] Hispanics  and don t deserve to be in the room. It was a moment where a reporter finally had enough of Trump s normalization of racism, white Nationalism, and xenophobic outlets like Gateway Pundit and Breitbart.The site s founder, Jim Hoft, is frequently referred to as  the stupidest man on the Internet  for his daily parade of false and idiotic coverage of politics. He has repeatedly ran stories that fail to hold up to even the most basic scrutiny and often deals in wild conspiracies. Trump may like them because they relentlessly suck up to him, but they are despicable liars who deal in misinformation and hate.After Decker called Wintrich out, chaos ensued:Fox News Radio John Decker just loudly told everyone in briefing room that Gateway Pundit is here ""they hate blacks, Jews, Hispanics."" Wild  Adrian Carrasquillo (@Carrasquillo) March 10, 2017He was speaking to Lucian Wintrich. He said it twice, pointing to him, so everyone knew who he was. https://t.co/42njWQQ0fX  Adrian Carrasquillo (@Carrasquillo) March 10, 2017Needless to say, Wintrich saw things differently. On Twitter, he whined that he was  assaulted  by Decker. Apparently being called a racist is tantamount to a sucker punch for the poor conspiracy theorist. He also (hilariously) misspelled the word  assault  several times, again highlighting the caliber of writer Trump personally gave a seat in the press briefing room.Jon Decker asulted me at today's briefing. @FoxNews   is this behavior something you tolerate over there? He's sick .https://t.co/gzZhhIzOMD pic.twitter.com/ThppoHpRQw  Lucian B.

Wintrich (@lucianwintrich) March 10, 2017Wintrich also said he would be pressing charges against Decker for  assult  and also for harassment   ironic because Trump s campaign manager Corey Lewandowski once claimed it was no big deal when he yanked the arm of a female reporter who had dared to ask Trump a question as he walked out of a rally.In a statement, Decker pointed out that at no point did he  assault  Wintrich, who appears to be lying. Earlier today I had a conversation with a representative from the online publication Gateway Pundit.  The conversation was straightforward and direct. I also informed the full White House pool that this representative was present in the Briefing Room. At no time did I accost or assault this individual. More than a dozen witnesses will attest to this fact. For Trump to be stopped, reporters as well as ordinary citizens need to stand up to the normalization of his descent into racism and xenophobia. Inviting a fear-mongering, disreputable smear merchant like The Gateway Pundit into the White House shows a level of disrespect for the American people that transcends politics. Kudos to Decker for standing up and loudly saying that it s not okay.Featured image via Twitter",0

Scott Walker disrupted the debate this week when he said that legal immigration also needs to be reformed to make sure Americans don t suffer by losing jobs to new citizens.But even more, the CIS report said that the surge in mostly legal immigrants will have a huge impact on the nation and taxpayers. These numbers have important implications for workers, schools, infrastructure, congestion and the environment,  said Steven Camarota, the center s director of research.  They also may have implications for our ability to successfully assimilate and integrate immigrants. Yet there has been almost no national debate about bringing in so many people legally each year, which is the primary factor driving these numbers. Those numbers are likely to shake up Washington s political debate over the 12 million illegals in America, the expected 70,000 expected to pour over the border this year and the 4.4 million legal immigrants on a State Department waiting list who have relatives or jobs in the U.S.A key senator steering the immigration debate, Alabama Republican Jeff Sessions, has warned that higher numbers of immigrants will hurt the middle class. In a letter to the New York Times Saturday, he wrote,  It defies reason to argue that the record admission of new foreign workers has no negative effect on the wages of American workers, including the wages of past immigrants hoping to climb into the middle class. Why would many of the largest business groups in the United States spend millions lobbying for the admission of more foreign workers if such policies did not cut labor costs? On Friday, key business leaders including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a group associated with former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg plan to pitch for more immigration. Their schedule is below.The numbers, as seen in the highlights below, will also raise concerns that Washington is giving the keys to the nation to new immigrants:  The immigrant population will grow four times faster than the native born population, reaching 15.8 percent, or 57 million, of the nation s population in 2030, 17.1 percent, or 65 million, in 2040, and 18.8 percent, or 78 million, in 2060.  Net immigration this year will be 1.24 million; green cards about 1.1 million.  Immigrants and their descendants  will account for the overwhelming share of population growth,  said the Center in projecting growth. They will account for 75.5 percent from 2010-2050 and 82 percent from 2010-2060.  Census Bureau projects that in 2023 the nation s immigrant population, legal and illegal, will reach 14.8 percent of the total U.S. population, the highest share ever recorded.Via: Washington Examiner",0

But the true political agenda comes from those who won t acknowledge that commonsense gun legislation would save lives and think that protesting racial injustice is the same thing as protesting against police officers themselves, the military, and the country.

As of now, this doesn t appear to have had anything to do with hatred of police officers and we can t say it did until Paddock s motive is discovered.It s true that mass shootings and really, any crime would be worse if it weren t for the law enforcement officers who risk their lives to stop them, but Lt.

But a Wisconsin lawmaker thinks that women should be forced to get pregnant and give birth.Wisconsin state GOP Rep. Scott Allen made the horrendous remarks while criticizing a bill that would block state employees from covering abortion with their health insurance.Because he doesn t think the bill goes far enough.Seriously.Allen pitched his idea to force women to give birth, and tried to justify his idea by claiming that forcing women to give birth will somehow help the economy. Labor force shortages are tied to population declines. Labor force shortages are a limiting factor in economic growth. Limited economic growth poses a problem when government tries to pay for public services and infrastructure. In spite of this Mr. Speaker, ironically, the Democrats continue their efforts to support the abortion industry. See what he did there? Allen claims that forcing women to give birth against their will is good for the economy. I m sure he would say the same thing about slavery, too.Here s the video via Twitter.Your #saturdaymorning WTF:WI Rep. Scott Allen says women should be made to give birth for the good of the economy.?pic.twitter.com/db01mkLQMl  Holly O'Reilly (@AynRandPaulRyan) November 4, 2017Allen is, of course, wrong. The fact is that there are millions of Americans who are currently unemployed. There are more people in this country than there are jobs. More people will not solve the economic problems we face today. And if women are forced to have babies, it will only make the problem worse, especially among teens. Teen girls who get pregnant and have babies are at an economic disadvantage. Many are forced to drop out of school and forgo college, making it more difficult for them to get high-paying jobs.The lack of child care services in this country also makes it difficult for women to work and take care of their children at the same time.The cost of raising children is incredibly expensive now, and most people are struggling to get by as it is. More kids will just add more struggle and stress. This country has a sufficient labor force. The problem is that businesses would rather hire what amounts to slave laborers overseas. Wages are also too low, which prevents most people from sparking economic growth through spending. If all workers can do with the little money they get is pay bills, it leaves very little left to spend at area businesses.In the end, forcing women to have kids is unconstitutional and will do nothing to grow the economy. Forcing big business to pay worker a livable wage, however, will turn the economy into the powerhouse it once was.Featured Image: Screenshot",0

74,"On Tuesday, Donald Trump told a story about Air Force One and former President Barack Obama. The only problem is that it never happened. Before boarding the plane to come home, Trump told the press that Air Force One was denied landing rights in the Philippines during a trip by his predecessor because U.S. relations with the nation were so bad.Trump said Air Force One  never got to land  in the Philippines while be bragged about having  a very strong relationship  with the Southeast Asian nation. And as you know, we were having a lot of problems with the Philippines. The relationship with the past administration was horrible, to use a nice word,  Trump told reporters in Manila. I would say  horrible  is putting it mildly. You know what happened. Many of you were there, and you never got to land,  he continued.  The plane came close but it didn t land. The Associated Press fact-checked Trump s bizarre claim:President Barack Obama last visited the Philippines in November 2015, arriving in Manila after an overnight flight from Turkey. There were no problems with landing the plane. Obama used the visit to announce the United States was transferring two ships to the Philippine Navy.Perhaps Trump was referring erroneously to Obama s aborted meeting with President Rodrigo Duterte? In September 2016, Obama abruptly canceled a meeting with the new Philippines leader in Laos after Duterte called him an obscene name. Duterte was warning Obama not to speak with him about the brutality of his crackdown on the illegal drug trade.Obama did visit the Philippines on several trips earlier in his presidency and even signed an enhanced defense cooperation agreement with the country in 2014, but Trump claimed that our relationship with the Philipines is  probably better than ever before. So it s very important that we get along with the Philippines, and we really do. We have a very good relationship. I would actually say probably better than ever before,  he said.Duterte has carried out an unlawful crackdown on suspected drug dealers and users, resulting in at least 7 thousand deaths by means including execution using death squads. Hitler massacred 3 million Jews. There are 3 million drug addicts. I d be happy to slaughter them,  Duterte declared in 2015.However, while Trump was there he largely ignored any discussion of human rights with the dictator. We understand that Trump is jealous of President Obama, but his lies prove why he has so much disdain for fact-checkers. It s sad that he doesn t have that same disdain for murderous dictators, though.Photo by Zach Gibson   Pool/Getty Images.",0

796,"Republicans apparently have no idea what they believe anymore. The only constant in the GOP universe these days is believing whatever it is Trump wants them to believe.That s the only explanation I can think of for the results of the following polls. This one, from Politico, shows overwhelming numbers of Republican supporting direct federal negotiation with individual businesses, tax breaks or incentives offered to specific individual businesses ( crony capitalism ), and advantages on government contractors for specific businesses:The best part? Even the GOP platform doesn t agree! Here s more, directly from the 2016 platform:Cronyism is inherent in the progressive vision of the administrative state. When government uses taxpayer funding and resources to give special advantages to private companies, it distorts the free market and erodes public trust in our political system. By enlarging the scope of government and placing enormous power in the hands of bureaucrats, it multiplies opportunities for corruption and favoritism. It is the enemy of reform in education, the workplace, and healthcare. It gives us financial regulation that protects the large at the cost of the small. It is inherent in every part of the current healthcare law, which is packed with corporate welfare. Crony capitalism gives us special interest tax breaks, custom-designed regulations, and special exemptions for favored parties. The Solyndra debacle is a perfect example. It creates both subsidies and restrictions to tilt the market one way or the other. By putting the weight of government behind the status quo, it leads to economic stagnation.Now, I feel it is important to note that I don t agree with Republican economic theories at all. There is no such thing as a truly  free market  when markets are an abstract concept defined by and regulated by a central authority   no matter how much libertarian-minded conservatives may wish otherwise. Yet it can t be denied that Trump and pence   and GOP views right now overall   do not see remotely eye to eye with the stance outlined in the platform.Strong regulatory rules that are the same for everyone (progressive economics) are a far cry from  whoever the president wants to win, wins.  What Republicans are currently claiming to be in support of isn t a free market. It s fascism, and it s as big as big government gets. Even Sarah fucking Palin understands that!It gets better. Another poll, from the Economist/YouGov, shows that Republicans are completely open with their newfound lack of free market economics:As you can see, traditional politics has been turned on its head   this poll shows MUCH higher support for free market economics among Democrats and independents than Republicans.Now, interpretation. I don t think anything has actually changed at all for the average Republican voter. They believe the same things day to day they always did. They re just not that smart, and they have way too much respect for authoritative leaders   they re authoritarian followers who think a  strong  leader like Trump always knows what is best. So this is less of a case of switched beliefs, and more a case of  whatever dad says goes. Some conservative leaders have tried to fight back against Trump s professed love of fascist economics, but the reasonable voices in the GOP (by their standard) should have learned that they were drowned out long ago. This is Trump s party now. And soon, it s Trump s America.The right wing has lost all sense of leadership and guidance and is now abandoning its own core principles in a desperate bid to retain power. And I don t mean over one election   they know the future of their party is in danger. Hillary s 2.6 million popular vote victory, the simmering anger of a large number of Americans, and the upcoming census elections are ensuring that the few smart Republicans left see the writing on the wall: unless they pull off some massive populist victories during the next few years, they re doomed.With Trump at the helm and support for fascism on the rise, things are not looking good.Featured image partial shot of embedded Politico poll",0
125,"A disturbing new report reveals that the staff at the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) have officially been instructed to begin censoring information on climate data. In fact, they are no longer even supposed to use the words  climate change  at all.According to emails between staff at the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), the staff has been told to use the term weather extremes  instead.The Guardian reports the following regarding an email dated February 16:A missive from Bianca Moebius-Clune, director of soil health, lists terms that should be avoided by staff and those that should replace them.  Climate change  is in the  avoid  category, to be replaced by  weather extremes . Instead of  climate change adaption , staff are asked to use  resilience to weather extremes .The primary cause of human-driven climate change is also targeted, with the term  reduce greenhouse gases  blacklisted in favor of  build soil organic matter, increase nutrient use efficiency . Meanwhile,  sequester carbon  is ruled out and replaced by  build soil organic matter .Moebius-Clune explained that we won t change the modeling, just how we talk about it   there are a lot of benefits to putting carbon back in the sail [sic], climate mitigation is just one of them.  She claims a colleague from the USDA s public affairs team advised them to  tamp down on discretionary messaging right now. Jimmy Bramblett, deputy chief for programs at the NRCS told senior employees that Trump was behind the decision to begin censoring important climate change data. It has become clear one of the previous administration s priority is not consistent with that of the incoming administration. Namely, that priority is climate change. Please visit with your staff and make them aware of this shift in perspective within the executive branch,  Bramblett wrote on January 24.The USDA issued a statement on January 23 that said,  interim operating procedures outlining procedures to ensure the new policy team has an opportunity to review policy-related statements, legislation, budgets, and regulations prior to issuance. This guidance, similar to procedures issued by previous administrations, was misinterpreted by some to cover data and scientific publications. This was never the case and USDA interim procedures will allow complete, objective information for the new policy staff reviewing policy decisions,  the statement added.And it isn t just the USDA. Since Trump took office, all mention of climate change has been scrubbed from the websites for both the White House and the Department of the Interior. The EPA has also removed its sections on climate change while they are  updating language to reflect the approach of new leadership. This is troubling, to say the least. These records reveal Trump s active censorship of science in the name of his political agenda,  said Meg Townsend, open government attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity.  To think that federal agency staff who report about the air, water, and soil that sustains the health of our nation must conform their reporting with the Trump administration s anti-science rhetoric is appalling and dangerous for America and the greater global community. 2017-NRCS-00240-A-3 by The Guardian on ScribdFeatured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",0
261,"Republicans in Texas, including Gov. Greg Abbott, ripped into the new $44 billion White House disaster relief aid request as  inadequate.  It s been two months since the state was devastated by Hurricane Harvey and Donald Trump has failed on his promise to rebuild Texas. Abbott s criticism is strikingly different than the day after Trump visited Texas in the aftermath of the hurricane. His commitment was firm, strong and unequivocal,  Abbott said at the time.  That he was going to do everything he could to ensure that Texas will be restored as swiftly, as effectively as possible. But now, two months later, Republicans are calling the response  wholly inadequate,  according to the Dallas News.The White House disaster relief aid request falls well short of the demands made by officials from Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico.Greg Abbott said that the request  does not live up  to what Trump pledged in recovery aid. Abbott noted during a news conference that he s still reviewing the White House request but that it appears to be  completely inadequate.  What s more, Abbott said, it  does not live up  to what Trump has pledged in recovery aid, then he said that Washington worked faster for victims of Superstorm Sandy than for Harvey. Superstorm Sandy hit in 2012 during the Obama administration, by the way. The president has told me privately what he said publicly, and that is he wants to be the builder president. The president has said he wants this to be the best recovery from a disaster ever,  Abbott said.It s not just Abbott. Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican, blasted the request as  wholly inadequate.  A chorus of Texas lawmakers slammed it as insufficient.Houston Rep. John Culberson, a Republican and appropriations committee member, ripped Trump s recovery efforts, calling the request a  complete lack of understanding of the fundamental needs of Texans  and said it is a  nightmare  for Harvey survivors.Democrats, too, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Florida Sen. Bill Nelson, are criticizing the measure as measly.If only someone has warned Abbott and his Republican colleagues to not trust Trump, then maybe they wouldn t be so shocked. Maybe we would have a different leader who has the ability to deal with critical issues. Wait, they were warned, weren t they?Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images.",0
594,"Donald Trump s lewd comments about sexually assaulting women in a 2005 leaked audio tape are wreaking havoc on his presidential campaign. Not only are prominent Republicans distancing themselves from him, but even his own running mate, Mike Pence, looks like he s about to jump ship.First, Pence pulled out of a Wisconsin rally, where Donald Trump said Pence would be taking the place of House Speaker Paul Ryan, who also canceled following the tape s release. Now, Pence has canceled a New Jersey fundraiser for Trump that was supposed to take place today   signaling a trend of upcoming disruptions in Trump s campaign schedule. There were supposed to be 250 people at this event, who all paid $50 to attend.This isn t surprising, considering how strongly Pence opposed Trump s disrespectful, misogynistic comments in the 2005 recording. Trump s running mate released a statement that said: As a husband and father, I was offended by the words and actions described by Donald Trump in the eleven-year-old video released yesterday. I do not condone his remarks and cannot defend them. This cancellation is even more questionable considering that on Trump s campaign website, a message showed that all Mike Pence events had been canceled:Trump website The site was later updated with two new events for today   in North Carolina instead of New Jersey   but this is certainly a strange move for a campaign. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks has not yet returned comment on whether Pence would actually be attending the North Carolina events   we wouldn t be surprised if he skipped those, too.It could very well be that Trump s degrading, rape-like comments about how he interacts with women were the final straw for the Republican party, and the final straw for Pence. It s bad enough that Pence and Trump have previously disagreed on several policies and issues   but now it seems that Trump has crossed the line and Pence can t stand to represent him any longer.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images",0

You would, like anyone concerned for themselves and their family, want to get out as soon as possible. And the quickest way to evacuate from anywhere is the fastest method of travel on earth: Air. But you hit a small snag. You don t have the goddamn fortune that the airlines are now charging for flights that were less than half as much the day before. That has to be against the law, right?Wrong. In Florida, where Hurricane Irma is bearing down like a banshee, there are price-gouging laws like there are in every state. But airlines don t answer to specific states. They re regulated by the FAA and the Department of Transportation, which means no state or local statutes apply to them.So when Lisette Diaz tried to book a flight to get her family out of South Florida, she found that flights from the area   during what is normally a lull in the travel season in Florida   had skyrocketed from a few hundred dollars to over $3,000. Trying to get to New York, she finally settled on tickets out of Fort Lauderdale that cost upwards of $1,300 per traveler. According to the Miami Herald, there were four people traveling with her, including her mother, grandmother, adult cousin, and 11-year-old sister. $6,600 later, she had her tickets.Diaz was far from the only person to run into price gouging. Florida s Attorney General Pam Bondi activated the state s price-gouging hotline for travelers to report these egregious acts.The Herald reported that Antonio Mercurius actually got his tickets from Miami to D.C. on Monday, before the pricing spikes. Out of curiosity, he checked the price of the same ticket the next day and found it had gone up more than 800% per ticket. Said Mercurius,I understand supply and demand but the laws of capitalism should not operate in the times of catastrophic danger.

When you re attacking FBI agents because you re under criminal investigation, you re losing,  Sanders tweeted in 2016 just before the election.When you're attacking FBI agents because you're under criminal investigation, you're losing https://t.co/SIoAxatCjp  Sarah Sanders (@SarahHuckabee) November 3, 2016Twitter users pounced.  that did age so well!!

460,"Donald Trump and his supporters are absolutely crazy. There is video that has surfaced from a rally from this weekend with his supporters doing a Hitler-esque salute and telling reporters to go to Auschwitz, and of course we all know about the outbreaks of racist violence. Well, the one that really takes the case is how Trump and his supporters have managed to make a great part of his ignorant base believe that a protester who rushed the stage is somehow connected the terrorist group ISIS.The protester, identified as 22-year-old college student and activist Thomas DiMassimo, is in no way tied to ISIS. However, Trump and his supporters have plowed on with this ridiculous and untrue theory. Trump was questioned about the spreading of this lie on a recent edition of Meet The Press, when the shutting down of his Chicago rally due to violence was addressed. He gave his usual crazy and uninformed answer, and said,  All I know is what s on the internet. So, we have a guy who literally is winning the race to be a presidential nominee who lies all the time and admits to believing everything he reads online. That s scary as hell, to say the least. He even tweeted out the fake video created by his lying fans:USSS did an excellent job stopping the maniac running to the stage. He has ties to ISIS. Should be in jail! https://t.co/tkzbHg7wyD?ssr=true  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 12, 2016Journalist John Harwood tweeted this ridiculous travesty:Trump response to being told video connecting rally protestor to ISIS is a hoax: ""all I know is what's on the Internet""  John Harwood (@JohnJHarwood) March 13, 2016Of course, we also know that Trump is now threatening protesters with arrests that will  ruin their lives  if they exercise their First Amendment rights against the hateful environment of his rallies as well. His supporters are also still steadily spreading the lie that DiMassimo is an ISIS supporter, though the FBI has thoroughly debunked that claim. The edited video that they used to promote that dangerous nonsense was actually of the young man at a protest that had nothing to do with ISIS. DiMassimo says of his reasons for rushing Trump on stage and taking the disorderly conduct charge: We must nonviolently shut down every Trump rally. We must stop this violent, foolish man from taking this country and destroying it. Thomas DiMassimo is absolutely correct. Trump is America s Adolf Hiter, and the really scary part is that a lot of people are too blinded by bigotry, hate, and fear to see it.Featured image via video screen capture from Addicting Info archives",0

482,"The Atlantic, a publication that wouldn t know unbiased journalism if it bit them in the a$$ published what appears to be a reluctant piece on President Trump s outstanding accomplishments during his first 6 months in office. Most of the people reading this piece by The Atlantic are fans of their writing because they ve bought into the progressive, anti-American sentiment they were fed like crack cocaine in college. Almost like the patch that smokers wear to help them get through the withdrawal of nicotine while going through a cessation program, The Atlantic provides their readers with enough anti-Trump propaganda to keep them in business, while acting like a support group for their readers, who fear every anti-American piece of legislation Barack Obama worked so hard to implement, is all unraveling, thanks to this guy who  foolishly  wants  Make America Great Again . Of course, in the eyes of The Atlantic reader, America was never great to begin with.The parts where The Atlantic talks about President Trump s accomplishments are italicized and the comments the writer makes to counter Trump s successes have been highlighted.The Atlantic starts out the article by giving credit to Trump s  shadow government , as somehow being responsible for his amazing successes in his first 6 months. According to The Atlantic, the  actual government  is the fake news stories and the obsession with negative chatter surrounding Trump s presidency, while President Trump s accomplishments have been hidden in the  shadows .The Atlantic  Imagine, if you will, that there is a shadow government.The actual government, the administration of Donald Trump, is coming off the worst week of his presidency, although there haven t been any smooth weeks. Trump s top legislative priority, repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, seems dead for the moment. (Tax reform? Forget it.) His administration has set a new standard for chaos and dysfunction, rolling through staffers the way other administrations run through, well, legislative initiatives. Trump s foreign policy remains inchoate and ineffective. Meanwhile, a special counsel investigation looms over the entire administration, threatening both its legitimacy and legal jeopardy for some of its members.Things are going considerably better for the shadow government. With the Trump administration s chaos sucking up all the attention, it s been able to move forward on a range of its priorities, which tend to be more focused on regulatory matters anyway. It is remaking the justice system, rewriting environmental rules, overhauling public-lands administration, and greenlighting major infrastructure projects. It is appointing figures who will guarantee the triumph of its ideological vision for decades to come. let s consider the Trump administration s accomplishments. Spoiler alert: like climate change, they re real.One of the two biggest victories has come on border security, which was one of Trump s top campaign priorities. Border crossings have already plummeted, suggesting that rhetoric making it clear to immigrants that they are not welcome is effective in its own right. Customs and Border Protections report that apprehensions of unauthorized people are down nearly 20 percent from the same time in 2016. (Trump continues to radically exaggerate these figures, though.) This decline has occurred despite Trump being foiled on his actual policy proposals at the border. Construction hasn t begun on his border wall yet, and federal courts have repeatedly smacked down his Muslim travel ban.That said, he did get one good result in courts and that points to a second area of success. The Supreme Court allowed parts of the travel ban to go forward, in a victory that would not have happened without Neil Gorsuch on the court, filling a seat that under all previous customs would have been filled by Barack Obama s appointee Merrick Garland. Given his legislative struggles, the most enduring Trump victories are likely to come in the judicial branch.Trump may get to appoint several more justices to the high court. And in the meantime, he s filling up lower courts with lifetime appointees. As the veteran Democratic official Ron Klain wrote recently,  A massive transformation is underway in how our fundamental rights are defined by the federal judiciary. For while President Trump is incompetent at countless aspects of his job, he is proving wildly successful in one respect: naming youthful conservative nominees to the federal bench in record-setting numbers. There are the quiet, far-reaching changes. Getting back to Pruitt, the environment is one of the places where the Trump administration has had its largest impact. The most prominent move was Trump s June 1 announcement that the U.S. will withdraw from the Paris climate accord. But the EPA is moving on other fronts as well. It s working to dismantle Barack Obama s Clean Power Plan, a signature policy aimed at reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. In June, following a February executive order from Trump, the EPA began the process of rescinding the 2015 Waters of the United States rule, which aimed at protecting smaller bodies of water and streams in the same way that larger ones had been. In December, in the closing weeks of his administration, Obama banned drilling in the Arctic and parts of the Atlantic Ocean; the Trump administration promptly set about undoing that ban. (How interested oil companies will be remains to be seen.)The New York Times found in June that Pruitt s EPA  has moved to undo, delay or otherwise block more than 30 environmental rules, a regulatory rollback larger in scope than any other over so short a time in the agency s 47-year history.  And it might have done more if not for constraints imposed by judges. EPA tried to abandon an Obama-era rule on methane emissions, but a court on Monday forced it to continue enforcing the rule.Other agencies are also in on the environmental deregulation act. The State Department reversed an Obama-era decision, clearing the way for the Keystone XL pipeline to begin construction. The Interior Department is considering reversing a rule on fracking on public lands, and might also reverse some equipment regulations on offshore drilling equipment implemented after the 2010 Gulf oil spill. The department has rolled back a ban on coal mining on public lands.Although the Justice Department had staunchly opposed a Texas voting law that has repeatedly been smacked down by courts as discriminatory, Sessions switched the department s position, and it has now told courts the law ought to be allowed to remain. The attorney general has also sought to cut off funding to so-called sanctuary cities, though his legal authority to do so is disputed.Curiously, since he campaigned as an atypically LGBT-friendly Republican, Trump has also made a range of changes on gay issues. Last week alone, the Justice Department announced that sexual orientation was not covered by Section VII, and the president said that transgender people would not be allowed to serve in the military. The administration has also rejected Obama-era protections for transgender students. ",0

1015,"If a grand jury indicts Donald Trump, one Fox News host wants conservatives to revolt in retaliation.When Robert Mueller impaneled a grand jury to hear evidence in Trump s Russia scandal, it was a huge deal.Should Trump get indicted, he would be the first president to get indicted.Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton were nearly indicted but special prosecutors waited for impeachment proceedings instead. Nixon resigned before he could be impeached and was subsequently pardoned by Geral Ford. Clinton s impeachment trial ended in his favor, so Ken Starr abandoned the indictment effort.Trump, however, is not being impeached at the moment because Republicans still refuse to do their constitutional duty. So the next best thing is a criminal indictment, which could be slapped against Trump or any member of his family if the grand jury sees fit to do so.That s going to depend on the evidence, of which there is plenty thanks to Donald Trump Jr., who released emails confirming that Trump s campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 Election.Fox News host Jeanine Pirro all but directly threatened bloody violence if the grandy jury indicts Trump or any member of his family, even if the evidence proves one or all of them broke the law. I m sure this is on Donald s mind, he never stops thinking,  Pirro began.  But at the same time, this is an agenda. Pirro then warned that an  uprising  will occur upon indictment. Here is my concern. If they end up with an indictment against a family member, just to get at Donald Trump because they couldn t get at him, there is going to be a real uproar, a real uprising in this country. Pirro then accused Mueller of rigging the grand jury against Trump. I was a prosecutor for 32 years, you can indict a ham sandwich. The only person in that grand jury is the district attorney who is interacting with all of those grand jurors on what the law is   and the body language is clear! Here s the video via Twitter..@JudgeJeanine: There will be an uproar in this country if they end up with an indictment against a Trump family member just to get at POTUS pic.twitter.com/tm10kRA2Ws  FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) August 4, 2017If indicting somebody is that easy, one wonders why so many police officers have been let off the hook by grand juries in recent years. Indeed, grand juries have failed to indict in clear cases where police officers murdered unarmed black men. Just look at the Eric Garner case for example. Garner was strangled to death just for allegedly selling cigarettes. The grand jury in that case decided not to indict the officer who killed him even though Garner s death was ruled a homicide.The evidence was clear. Garner s death was even caught on film. It should have been enough to send the police officer to prison. Instead, the grand jury chose to indict the man who filmed Garner s murder.Clearly, Pirro is wrong about grand juries.Pirro is also wrong to incite an  uprising  just because the walls of justice are closing in on Trump and his crime family. This amounts to a threat against the grand jury, which could be seen as interference. Pirro is literally telling the grand jury to absolve Trump or face possible violent retribution. That s unacceptable and Robert Mueller should question Pirro for it.She may be a former judge and prosecutor, but tampering with a grand jury in this way is still a crime she could be punished for.Featured Image: Screenshot",0
541,"As the investigations into how Russia meddled in our election escalate, Facebook has turned records relating to ad buys from Russian actors over to Congress. Facebook has found itself in the crosshairs of Democrats and Republicans alike because of this (and for other reasons), and Mark Zuckerberg is finally, finally wondering if maybe he should be taking a more active role in his own company.Why? Because Facebook sold over 3,000 pro-Trump and pro-right wing ads to fake accounts run by Russians and people with ties to Russia. They turned those records over to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees and to Special Counsel Robert Mueller. They re going to re-evaluate the processes they use to review political ads, and they will supposedly  offer a higher standard of transparency  on those ads than what the law requires for radio, television and other platforms.For many, it s too little, too late, though. Trump was elected, a hostile foreign power helped him win, and the true scope of how Russia used and manipulated Facebook is still unknown. When they first came under fire for allowing the proliferation of fake news following Trump s  win,  Zuckerberg s excuse was that they were a technology company, not a media company. The implication was that they couldn t be held responsible for any of that.They re only now starting to come around to the truth, but the sad thing about this is that Zuckerberg was warned about people misusing his platform to swing the election several times. In fact, none other than President Obama himself literally pulled Zuckerberg aside during a conference in Peru to practically beg him to take the threat of fake news and disinformation seriously. Obama told Zuckerberg that, unless he actually paid attention, this would only be worse in four years.But Zuckerberg blew him off. He told Obama that such messages weren t widespread on his platform, and that there wouldn t be an easy solution to it. Like his pathetic excuse of being a tech company, Zuckerberg shirked any and all responsibility for it. Obama tried. Zuckerberg didn t really seem to care.Discovering that another country would even dare to try and influence our elections should be a horrific epiphany for any American. It s true that neither Zuckerberg, nor anyone else at Facebook (or anyone really) could have sufficiently predicted that anything like this would happen. As recently as two to three years ago, most of us would have made fun of the conspiracy theorists making bizarre claims about shady and hostile foreign actors working to swing our elections to their favor. That s reality now, but early warnings like Obama s seem to have slid right off Zuckerberg s back, as he was more concerned with his product than with how his product was being misused.Russia weaponized Facebook, and it s not over. Facebook has its part to do and they need to get to it post-haste. But another part may lie with Washington, with our lawmakers. It may well be time to apply laws similar to those that govern political advertising elsewhere to social media. Facebook hasn t yet provided many details about how they ll be transparent, especially given the fact that many of their political ads don t meet current legal definitions for political ads. They are, however, talking the talk. Now they need to walk the walk, or be forced to do so under law.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",0

10,"If Donald Trump and his team are trying to pretend that everything is fine and nothing s wrong, they re not doing a very good job.Earlier today, Trump kicked off the morning by indulging in his habitual Twitter habit whenever he s nervous about something. Providing a distraction from former FBI Director James Comey s testimony, Trump decided to announce his pick for a new FBI Director   signaling that Trump is nervous as hell and desperate to take the heat off the Russia scandal. It turns out, his Vice President is also freaking out.Apparently, Mike Pence reacted to the release of Comey s opening statement by abruptly cancelling a scheduled interview   literally right before it was supposed to happen! Now, Pence is cowering and has gone into hiding. Here s what went down, according to PBS:Pence bailed with no warning whatsoever!Comey s released opening statement has clearly taken the White House by surprise, and everyone s in panic mode now. The White House has been on media lockdown since the release of the statement, and Pence s response surely raised suspicions.Pence, without a doubt, cancelled that interview so he wouldn t have to answer questions about Comey   because he could not only further incriminate Trump, but himself as well. Despite the fact that most of the focus has been on Trump, Pence is also in big trouble because of the Russia scandal. Trump s entire administration is in danger if he goes down.What happens tomorrow during Comey s testimony will likely change the entire direction of the Russia scandal, and it already looks as if it is going to mean bad news for Trump. All of the warning signs and red flags are present, and everyone close to Trump is now running for the hills. For Pence to cancel this interview certainly means something fishy is happening, and most of us can t wait to find out.Featured image via Alex Wong / Getty Images",0
252,"A conservation group and Democrat Congressman have filed a lawsuit to demanding an environmental study is performed before   construction of Trump s wall on the border between the US and Mexico. Biologist Jeff Corwin paid a visit to MSNBC to breathlessly warn viewers about the dangers of the wall President Trump plans to build on the Texas-Mexico border national security purposes. He warned viewers of the  unprecedented environmental catastrophic  consequences Trump s wall on wildlife. The MSNBC host responds to his highly dramatic warning by asking drama queen Jeff Crowin,  At the risk of sounding ignorant or foolish the birds specifically Wouldn t they be able to fly over that wall?'   HILARIOUS!Not surprisingly, there was no mention of wind turbines in Texas during the interview.Watch:Meanwhile in America, Democrats remain silent about the bird holocaust caused by wind turbines every year. An estimated 140,000 to 328,000 birds are killed every year in N. America by these green energy bird blenders.Instead of worrying about Trump s wall  killing birds  how about addressing these wind turbines in oil-rich Texas that liberal federally-funded NPR promoted while using a picture of turbines on top of a huge wall of dirt? NPR  Another record was set for wind power generation this week, according to the group that manages much of the state s power. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas(ERCOT) says Wednesday evening, wind power generation on the grid reached10,296 megawatts (MW), or enough to power 5 million Texas homes during times of regular demand. That beat the previous record of actual generation by 600 megawatts, roughly the equivalent of a medium-sized fossil fuel power plant.Here s the real danger to birds in America that few Democrats are willing to address:In 2010 David Newstead, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service field biologist, visited the Gulf shoreline of Laguna Madre, Texas, to survey skimmers, terns, and egrets. But it was a flock of 15 American White Pelicans that caught his eye, flying toward the nearby Pe ascal wind farm. As he watched, a pelican at the flock s tail end was swiped by a massive turbine blade and  literally  erased  from the air, Newstead wrote afterwards. This in itself isn t surprising wind turbines are notorious bird killers but this specific farm was supposedly equipped with radar that could detect approaching birds and halt the blades. The radar had failed to do its job.Watch as what appears as this bird that appears to be an eagle, is killed as it s chopped by a blade on this powerful wind turbine:Wind turbines kill an estimated 140,000 to 328,000 birds each year in North America, making it the most threatening form of green energy. And yet, it s also one of the most rapidly expanding energy industries: more than 49,000 individual wind turbines now exist across 39 states.  Audubon",0
5,"Since Donald Trump s November 8 election victory, there has been a significant rise in hate-based threats and attacks in the United States, with the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) documenting 1,863 such incidents between then and April, at least 330 of which took place on college campuses. In fact, in the 10 days following the election, there was an average of 87 incidents per day!At the peak of these occurrences immediately following the election, there was a 500 percent spike in bias-based incidents when compared to daily hate crimes reported by the FBI for all of 2015. To be completely honest, these types of incidents have decreased slightly in recent months, but the most troubling part of this whole situation is the increase in the severity of the attacks.What makes these incidents even more frightening is the sheer amount that occur on college campuses, thanks mostly to an upsurge in white supremacists campaigning and recruiting in American colleges. It is getting so bad that the SPLC has documented more than 135 incidents of white supremacist and nationalist recruitment efforts on US campuses since the commencement of the 2016 academic year. It s a definite uptick, and they ve been making a concerted effort to flyer and paper as many campuses as they possibly can,  says Lecia Brooks, the SPLC s outreach director, adding that the campaigning has notably increased since Trump s Presidential victory. It shouldn t be hidden,  Brooks said in reference to incidents documented at schools across the entire country.  The [university] administrations should always issue a strong statement of condemnation clearly stating who they [white supremacist groups] are and what they represent, encouraging students to disregard their recruitment [drives] and disavow their message. The result of these recruitment efforts is a huge escalation in hate-based incidents on college campuses, including Tommy Curry, an African-American philosophy professor at Texas A&M University, constantly receiving death threats via email and voice messages, the stabbing death of Richard W Collins, an African-American Bowie State University student, while visiting the University of Maryland and the election of Taylor Dumpson, American University in Washington DC s first African-American, female student-government president, being met with nooses tied around the campus with bananas labeled  Harambe Bait.  And those are only the tip of the iceberg. I think the most threatening part is that we re beginning to see this rise up again because people feel comfortable and they feel empowered to have these kinds of beliefs, and that s terrifying,  Dumpson said.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",0

737,"You know how everyone suspected that there would be some quid pro quo for all the help Vladimir Putin gave Donald Trump during the election? Well, it s happening.On Thursday, Donald Trump lifted sanctions imposed by President Obama that prevented Putin from cyberspying. The sanctions were a response to Putin s team of hackers doing Trump a series of favors by hacking his political opponents and releasing any and all information they could that could assist him in becoming President. Reuters reports:The Treasury Department said in a statement it would allow U.S. companies to make limited transactions with the intelligence service that are needed to gain approval to import information technology products into Russia.The broader significance of the sanctions exemptions were not immediately clear. The Treasury Department often issues general licenses such as the one announced on Thursday to help U.S. companies overcome unintended business consequences of sanctions.U.S. intelligence agencies accused the FSB of involvement in hacking of Democratic organizations during the election, won by Republican Donald Trump.The agencies and private cyber security experts concluded the FSB first broke into the Democratic National Committee s computer system in the summer of 2015 and began monitoring email and chat conversations.They say FSB was one of two Russian spy agencies believed to have been involved in a wide-ranging operation by top-ranking individuals in Russia s government to discredit Democrat Hillary Clinton and help Trump win the election.When Obama imposed the sanctions, Vladimir Putin announced that he would wait to respond until after Trump became President because he expected a response that favors him. This move was just the first of many we can expect to benefit Vladimir Putin. This is the same group (FSB) that, just a month ago, our intelligence community determined was responsible for the attack on our democracy,  Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., ranking member of a House CIA subcommittee, said in response to Trump  rewarding  Putin for his help during the election.  We just made it easier for the same group to import into Russia the tools they could use to hack us or our allies again.

332,"Republicans in Texas, including Gov. Greg Abbott, ripped into the new $44 billion White House disaster relief aid request as  inadequate.  It s been two months since the state was devastated by Hurricane Harvey and Donald Trump has failed on his promise to rebuild Texas. Abbott s criticism is strikingly different than the day after Trump visited Texas in the aftermath of the hurricane. His commitment was firm, strong and unequivocal,  Abbott said at the time.  That he was going to do everything he could to ensure that Texas will be restored as swiftly, as effectively as possible. But now, two months later, Republicans are calling the response  wholly inadequate,  according to the Dallas News.The White House disaster relief aid request falls well short of the demands made by officials from Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico.Greg Abbott said that the request  does not live up  to what Trump pledged in recovery aid. Abbott noted during a news conference that he s still reviewing the White House request but that it appears to be  completely inadequate.  What s more, Abbott said, it  does not live up  to what Trump has pledged in recovery aid, then he said that Washington worked faster for victims of Superstorm Sandy than for Harvey. Superstorm Sandy hit in 2012 during the Obama administration, by the way. The president has told me privately what he said publicly, and that is he wants to be the builder president. The president has said he wants this to be the best recovery from a disaster ever,  Abbott said.It s not just Abbott. Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican, blasted the request as  wholly inadequate.  A chorus of Texas lawmakers slammed it as insufficient.Houston Rep. John Culberson, a Republican and appropriations committee member, ripped Trump s recovery efforts, calling the request a  complete lack of understanding of the fundamental needs of Texans  and said it is a  nightmare  for Harvey survivors.Democrats, too, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Florida Sen. Bill Nelson, are criticizing the measure as measly.If only someone has warned Abbott and his Republican colleagues to not trust Trump, then maybe they wouldn t be so shocked. Maybe we would have a different leader who has the ability to deal with critical issues. Wait, they were warned, weren t they?Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images.",0

908,"Former President George W. Bush gave a speech on Thursday in which he said that  bigotry seems emboldened  in the U.S. and warned that Americans need to reject  white supremacy.  This is the speech that Trump should have given even before the Nazi march in Charlottesville. Donald Trump was backed by every white supremacist group across the board during his divisive campaign. Although Bush pointed to the  governing class,  he did not mention the former reality show star s name, but it was obvious that he was talking about Trump, his policies, and his base.Bush spoke of our  discourse being degraded by casual cruelty.  He continued to say that we ve seen nationalism distorted into nativism  and added that  we need to recover and recall our own identity. Discontent deepened and sharpened partisan conflicts  in recent years, Bush said in remarks from New York City at a forum focused on security and sponsored by the George W. Bush Institute. Bigotry seems emboldened. Our politics seem more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication,  the former President continued.Bush also warned against  a new era of cyber threats  including Russia s attempt to influence the 2016 presidential election, a thing which Donald Trump has called a hoax. Ultimately this assault won t succeed, but foreign aggressions including cyber attacks, disinformation, and financial influence should never be downplayed or tolerated,  he said. Bigotry or white supremacy in any form is blasphemy against the American creed,  Bush continued.The Hill reports:Bush, who advocates free trade, promoted multilateral and bilateral trade deals during his presidency. Trump is now demanding that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and Mexico be renegotiated, under the threat of a U.S. withdrawal. We cannot wish globalization away,  Bush said, then he went on to urge society to  adapt  to economic and social change.Bush went on to warn that democracies face  new and serious threats  today.Economic, political and national security challenges  proliferate,  he said. And they re made worse by the tendency to turn inward,  he said.  The health of the Democratic spirit itself is at issue and the renewal of that spirit is the urgent task at hand. Our governing class has often been paralyzed in the face of obvious and pressing needs. The American dream of upward mobility seems out of reach for some who feel left behind in a changing economy,  he added.Watch:President George W Bush in NYC:  We ve seen nationalism distorted into nativism we need to recall and recover our own identity  pic.twitter.com/dsiSkFzEVp  Pat Ward (@WardDPatrick) October 19, 2017While Bush wasn t a great president, he wasn t an evil man (his vice-president was a doozy, though).

George Washington, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Theodore Roosevelt retain their top five status, while Dwight Eisenhower moves into the top five for the first time,  according to the press release.  Former President Barack Obama enters the ranks for the first time in the number 12 position. Notably, his leadership category ratings range from number 3 for  Pursued Equal Justice for All,  to number 39 for  Relations with Congress. Historian Douglas Brinkley praised Obama s ranking as  impressive  considering this is the first time he was even eligible to be ranked.This news comes as Trump s approval rating has imploded and currently stands at 38 percent amid chaos and infighting in the White House. Whereas President Obama governed with a calm mind and steady hand, Trump has tried to govern through bullying and misinformation while being too thin-skinned to handle even the smallest criticism.Foreign nations like Russia and China are taking advantage of Trump, or challenging him and his domestic agenda which has been nothing but a disaster.In fact, Trump is so bad that historians actually ranked George W. Bush higher on the list than he was last year. George W. Bush, has benefited somewhat from the passing of years: His ranking at number 33, is up three places from our 2009 survey,  the press release continued.Indeed, Trump is so bad that many Americans actually miss Bush now.This is a major achievement for President Obama, who has spent his post-presidency living it up while Trump is busy putting out one fire after another and embarrassing himself on a daily basis. It s more than clear that President Obama was a real leader. Trump, on the other hand, will probably go down as the most inept and worst president in American history.Now we wait for Trump to throw a hissy fit.Featured image by Pete Souza/White House",0

992,"Sean Hannity threw a massive temper tantrum on Monday night in defense of Donald Trump.The Fox News host went off on a seriously delusional rant about Hillary Clinton, even referring to her as  President Clinton  on two occasions.Hannity whined about the indictments against Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, and just like Donald Trump, attempted to shift the focus from Trump s Russia collusion to Hillary Clinton. This is beyond insanity and it s inexcusable,  Hannity whined.  Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, the Obama Administration allowed your national security to be compromised in what is an unprecedented way and few in the media will touch this story. Major crimes were committed. They knew about it. They did nothing before the deal. Hannity is referring to the Uranium One deal the Obama Administration made with Russia back in 2010. Trump himself has been bellowing about it for quite some time now in a desperate effort to distract from his very real crimes.Basically, the deal gave a Russian company no more than a 51 percent stake in a Canadian-based mining company and ownership of  20 percent of the currently licensed uranium in-situ recovery production capacity in the U.S. This deal does not harm our national security as Hannity claims, nor did Hillary Clinton personally approve of the deal. Factcheck.org recently gave a run-down of the deal and thoroughly debunked Trump and Hannity s claims. As we ve written before, there is no evidence that donations to the Clinton Foundation from people with ties to Uranium One or Bill Clinton s speaking fee influenced Hillary Clinton s official actions,  FactCheck.org wrote.  That s still the case. In fact, not only did such a deal require approval from several federal agencies and committees, only 11 percent of overall U.S. production of uranium comes from Uranium One. And that uranium is sold to operators of commercial nuclear reactors. Basically, the uranium is being sold to us as it would have if Uranium One was not held by a Russian company. This deal was under a lot of scrutiny before it went through, and was even publicly announced. But Hannity did not utter one word about it when it happened.Of course, Hannity is still insisting that the evidence is on Trump s side despite the fact that there is a lot of evidence proving that he and Trump are full of shit and that Trump committed treason to steal an election. We are at a major crisis point in America tonight. Do we have equal justice under the law in this country today? If you or I or anybody in this room with me now or watching TV with you, if we ever did anything close to what the Clintons, the DNC, and others did, we would be rotting in a jail cell tonight hoping our friends would send us a cake that had a file. The only difference between Trump/Russia collusion is that we have the evidence, and after a year of black helicopter conspiracy theories, they have none. And just like we have the evidence, when it comes to Clinton and her email server scandal, why hasn t she been charged? Here s the video via YouTube.Hillary Clinton has not been charged because she didn t commit any crimes and there is ZERO evidence that she did. Trump, on the other hand, is about to go down for collusion.Clearly, nobody gives Trump a blowjob like Sean Hannity. And frankly, he and Fox News should be sued for slander.Featured Image: Screenshot",0

14,"If you re sitting at your computer, take a deep breath. If you re reading this on your phone, have a seat. Everything you think you know about how bad the Trump administration s response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico has been is about to get a whole lot worse.On Rachel Maddow s show Monday night, she discussed a small town in the mountains of Puerto Rico called Aibonito, roughly one and a half hours from the capital city of San Juan. If it seems like you re getting a geography lesson lately, that s good   even if it is because of listening to Trump trash talk mayors and citizens or watching him pelt churchgoers with rolls of paper towels.Showing video taken from a moving vehicle, Rachel describes the roads from the capital to Aibonito: Clear. Unblocked. As the cameras travel with the MSNBC team, you hear the point of Rachel s report, which is that after almost three weeks since the storm, FEMA still has not brought relief to the mountain town. And to hear them tell it, there s a reason.It s not their job.FEMA still has not delivered food or water to the completely accessible town. And make no mistake, FEMA knows that Aibonito is accessible at this point, because they ve been there three times. All three times, FEMA was on the scene to  help residents fill out paperwork  to apply for aid. Let s drag that acronym out into what it stands for: The Federal Emergency Management Agency. Heading to a remote mountain town that s been waiting three weeks for food and water to assist the pueblo in asking for help doesn t sound like anyone is managing any emergencies to me.Rachel first ran a profile on Aibonito on Friday, which is how she knew that FEMA had been there three times. After she ran that report, FEMA contacted her show, desperate to let the public know that they had once again made the literally unimpeded journey to Aibonito on Saturday, this time to speak to the mayor and file a report on the needs of the community. Still no food or water in their undoubtedly spacious trucks.The death toll in Puerto Rico has more than doubled since Donald Trump told the residents there that they should be grateful so few had died.But the part that will piss you off is the comparison between how the Trump administration has handled this  emergency management  as opposed to the emergencies in Texas and Florida. Shipping restrictions are back in place in Puerto Rico, making what little aid is coming hard to receive. The administration initially refused to lift a restriction on using food stamps to purchase ready-to-eat food, despite the grocery stores on the island being mostly closed until within the last week, and despite those stores that have reopened jacking up their prices. That s not how it went in the mainland US, where the  white people s hurricanes  saw victims able to use their food stamps to purchase McDonald s on day one, and where the federal government stepped in to help municipalities fight price gouging.There can be little doubt that the  emergency management  in Puerto Rico has suffered from a lack of compassion, and that erasing everything that puertorrique os have in common with Texans and Floridians   American citizenship, basic humanity, dire need   what s left is that they are a Spanish-speaking people. They are brown and seem foreign. They are underdogs, with a flag that isn t the same shape as the flags of the individual United States that fly at the same height: Just below the American flag.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",0

In reference to his complete lack of spine, a Wikipedia page listed him under invertebrates, joining the ranks of creatures like worms. Truly, there has never been a better way to describe Ryan and similar GOPers   until now.This edit to the invertebrate Wikipedia page was first spotted by BuzzFeed s Alp Ozcelik, and it is SO perfect:According to the Wikipedia page, invertebrates are characterized like this: The trait that is common to all invertebrates is the absence of a vertebral column (backbone): this creates a distinction between invertebrates and vertebrates. The distinction is one of convenience only; it is not based on any clear biologically homologous trait, any more than the common trait of having wings functionally unites insects, bats, and birds, or than not having wings unites tortoises, snails and sponges. Being animals, invertebrates are heterotrophs, and require sustenance in the form of the consumption of other organisms. With a few exceptions, such as the Porifera, invertebrates generally have bodies composed of differentiated tissues. There is also typically a digestive chamber with one or two openings to the exterior. We couldn t have said it better ourselves. Ryan s behavior when it comes to Trump has been extremely disappointing, and he has become more of a pushover since Trump officially became POTUS. Proving that he doesn t have the guts or spine to stand by his previous statements, Ryan quietly allowed Trump to go ahead with his Muslim ban this week, despite the fact that he felt VERY differently in July:To compare, this is what Ryan said after Trump signed his disastrous executive order this week: Our number one responsibility is to protect the homeland. We are a compassionate nation, and I support the refugee resettlement program, but it s time to reevaluate and strengthen the visa vetting process. This is why we passed bipartisan legislation in the wake of the Paris attacks to pause the intake of refugees. President Trump is right to make sure we are doing everything possible to know exactly who is entering our country. It is absolutely disgusting to have people like this in power. Fortunately, the internet came to our rescue to provide some much needed humor during a time when doom seems eminent.

233,"Two Florida Republican lawmakers voted against a $15 billion hurricane relief bill just as Irma churned toward the state. Congressmen Matt Gaetz (R-FL) and Ted Yoho (R-FL) claim they have concerns about other provisions of the measure. Irma is now a Category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph but forecasters expect the storm to strengthen. Presently, the Florida Keys is facing a potentially catastrophic force that could threaten to drown entire islands.But, it s obviously more important for Gaetz and Yoho to exercise their conservative bonafides.The relief package sailed through the Senate and the House and was signed by Donald Trump on Friday. The package boosts funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), a necessary move at this time following the destruction left by Hurricane Harvey and much more expected after Florida feels Irma s force and fury. Also, FEMA is running out of money so the funds are needed.The package will also raise the debt ceiling for three months and includes a short-term budget that would keep the government running until December. The deal struck between Trump and Democratic leaders Sen. Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) and Rep. Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) sent Republicans into a panic while disregarding that lives are at stake after the deadly storm obliterated Houston, Texas.The Washington Post reports:That latter was a problem for GOP Reps. Matt Gaetz and Ted Yoho, who stuck to their principles of fiscal conservatism despite calls from fellow Florida lawmakers to support the bill. The two, who are among the 90 House Republicans who voted against the bill, do not represent parts of the state that are likely to feel Irma s immediate impact as the massive storm makes landfall on mainland United States this weekend. Snaking in a debt-ceiling increase with funding for victims and communities affected is immoral and reflective of broken leadership in Washington,  Yoho said after the vote Friday.  I do not think it wise to extend our borrowing limit without mandatory spending reforms . . . If this was a clean measure that focused on those affected by Hurricane Harvey, I would have proudly voted for it. Gaetz, whose district includes coastal areas along the Gulf of Mexico, said the debt limit should be raised only if it includes cuts in entitlement programs, which is really heartless since many victims of the Hurricanes will need a hand up after losing everything they owned in the world. I have a pretty strident view that I will only vote to raise the debt limit if that vote is accompanied by reductions in entitlement spending,  Gaetz said.  If conservatives don t start voting no against debt-limit increases, all the FEMA in the world won t save us from our most unfortunate destiny. U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) was against federal aid for victims of Hurricane Sandy, then a natural disaster struck his state with deadly force. Suddenly, he s cool with aid being provided to his state. Funny how that works. But the other two Republicans just don t want to help anyone, even their own constituents.Photo: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images.",0

1090,"On May 31 the state of Arizona ran out of midazolam, a sedative which, when mixed with other drugs, can be used to carry out state-sponsored executions. Arizona officials later announced that the state had discontinued use of the drug altogether.This is good news for opponents of the death penalty. Thanks to their advocacy, the supply of midazolam has all but dried up in Arizona and elsewhere. Better still, Arizona is no longer able to obtain other drugs used in executions, such as pentobarbital and sodium thiopental.In a court filing this week, lawyers for the state basically admitted Arizona s hands are tied. According to the documents, Arizona is not able to execute inmates at this time, due to lack of access to various execution drugs.The last person to be executed in Arizona was Joseph Rudolph Wood. In 2014, Wood was given 15 doses of midazolam along with a pain killer. It took him two hours to die.Following the botched execution, attorney s from the public defender s office filed suit on behalf of Wood and other Arizona inmates. A coalition of media organizations joined in the suit, asking the court to compel the state to fully disclose how it handles executions.In a recent court filing, attorneys for the state of Arizona asked the judge to dismiss the lawsuit. The state claims that the suit is now moot, citing the fact that it is no longer able to carry out executions, due to lack of access to lethal-injection drugs.As Addicting Info reported here, federal authorities busted Arizona officials smuggling illegal drugs into the U.S. in October of last year. Federal agents confiscated an illegal shipment of sodium thiopental at the Phoenix Airport, which Arizona officials spent more than $27,000 of taxpayer money to obtain from Asia.The states of Texas and Nebraska were also busted for smuggling illegal drugs into the country last year.With Arizona s recent decision to discontinue the use of midazolam, the state s lack of access to other death penalty drugs in the U.S., and the federal government blocking attempts to obtain the drugs from overseas, Arizona is officially out of options for killing people.Image credit: Wikimedia Commons",0

West Deerfield Township will be led entirely by Democrats for the first time. Elgin Township voted for  a complete changeover,  flipping to an all-Democratic board. Normal Township elected Democratic supervisors and trustees to run its board   the first time in more than 100 years that a single Democrat has held a seat.

We won in areas we normally would win, but we also won in areas Republicans never expected us to be competitive in. They were caught flat-footed. Republicans apparently thought their seats were safe and that they would be able to easily run over their opponents for victory. But that did not happen last week.Donald Trump has done such a horrible job since taking office that even people who voted for him are seeing the light and turning on him.Because as it turns out, Trump s policies are going to hurt conservatives more. His attempt to kill the Affordable Care Act would have stripped millions of Americans of their healthcare. Trump is also launching assaults on Social Security and Medicare, environmental protections, education, etc And it s only getting worse as Trump is now close to dragging America into more wars as more fighting breaks out in the Middle East and North Korea makes threats.Trump has repeatedly proven that he doesn t give a damn about the American people. He only cares about himself and Americans who never paid attention to politics before are waking up and getting involved.That brings us back to the wins by Illinois Democrats and the rising tide that could bury Republicans in 2018 if they don t reverse course fast.Democrats are literally running competitive races and winning in areas that are dominated by a conservative population.They should be striking fear in the hearts and minds of every Republican lawmaker across the country right now. Because if Democrats can win here, they can win anywhere and even Republicans in the most staunchly Republican stronghold are not safe.These may have been just some local elections but grassroots efforts are the tip of the spear.At the state level, Republicans have also been struggling to keep long-held seats. A Kansas special election almost turned into a win for Democrats if not for a last minute flood of cash into the race by the Republican Party.And Democrats in Georgia are running a winning anti-Trump campaign that could give them another seat in the House that had traditionally been held by the GOP.Republicans also got their asses handed to them in Delaware by a Democrat running a similar campaign.In short, Trump has poisoned the Republican Party and Republicans only have themselves to blame. They picked Trump to be their leader, and he is now the face of their party. Everything he does reflects on them and the American people are incredibly angry about what Trump has been doing to our nation over the last three months. He has made us a laughingstock around the world.However, Republicans won t be laughing when the 2018 Election rolls around. They ll be devastated. And so will Donald Trump, because a Democratic wave in 2018 means he s likely to be a failed one-term president.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",0

1048,"The Obama administration s well guarded Osama bin Laden documents were released on Wednesday by CIA director Mike Pompeo. The documents were seized in a raid after U.S. SEAL Rob O Neill killed Osama bin Laden. The Obama administration basically politicized the intelligence agencies when they hand-picked just a few of the 470,000 documents to release. They hid damning evidence that could have hurt Obama s chance at reelection in 2012 .OBAMA RAN THE CLOCK OUT AL QAEDA WAS NOT  ON THE RUN :Steve Hayes of the Weekly Standard:  In a manner of speaking, Barack Obama wanted what al Qaeda already had: a mutually beneficial partnership with Tehran. Revealing to the American people the truth about Osama bin Laden s cozy working relationship with the Iranian government might have fatally undermined that diplomatic quest, just as the ongoing vitality of al Qaeda, amply testified to in the bin Laden documents, would have contradicted Obama s proud claims in 2012 that al Qaeda was  on the run.  So Obama, with the eager cooperation of some in the intelligence community, bottled up the bin Laden documents and ran out the clock.IRAN S CLOSE TIES TO AL QAEDA COULD HURT THE IRAN DEAL:Within the documents is an assessment by a senior jihadist with al Qaeda   Tehran ties: how Iran supplied  everything needed,  including  money, arms  and  training in Hezbollah camps in Lebanon,  including safe haven for other jihadis, the New York Post reported.The assessment is raising questions as to how much then-President Obama knew about Iran s ties to al Qaeda before making his controversial deal. And it points to the reason why the former administration might have kept the documents under lock and key.The Obama White House had this information for five years before making the nuclear deal that critics argued would ultimately make it easier for the terror state to build nuclear weapons. Bin Laden had called Iran a  main artery for funds, personnel and communication  for al Qaeda, the Post reported.That wasn t the only suspicious dealing Obama had with Iran. In August 2016, Republicans were furious over a reported deal Obama had made to release American hostages in Iran.The former administration denied paying $400 million in  ransom  for the hostages, arguing that it was part of a legal settlement in a long-standing case. However, it was only the first of three payments to the Iranians totaling $1.3 billion that took place after the hostage release, as the Wall Street Journal disclosed. And strikingly, much of the case came by way of plane-loads of cash in international currencies.But the revelations about bin Laden and the former administration don t end there.MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD CONNECTIONS TO BIN LADEN:In one of the 10,000 videos files contained within the newly released documents, bin Laden is asked to name is his influences. The terrorist leader didn t hesitate, The National reported. From a religious aspect, I was committed within the Muslim Brotherhood. Bin Laden also suggested the Muslim Brotherhood sponsored his first trip as a young jihadi. It was the first time I travelled to a country where I did not know the language,  he writes.  I carried a pistol and went. The Brotherhood, they had poor knowledge about things. If they knew, I would not have had to travel through Syria to Antakya 12 hours by bus to reach Istanbul. It was easier from Jeddah to Istanbul by plane. Three hours by plane. MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD CONNECTIONS TO CLINTONS:Critics of the Muslim Brotherhood have long warned of its terror affiliation and infiltration into the West. One Brotherhood official Gehad el-Haddad was arrested two years ago in Cairo for inciting violence. El-Haddad (pictured below) previously worked as an executive for the Clinton Foundation.

643,"On Tuesday, it was announced that Donald Trump has elected to keep James Comey (that nice gentleman who helped swing the election in Trump s favor by sending Republicans a letter falsely indicating that a new investigation into Hillary Clinton was being opened just before the election) as FBI Director. That s a move The New York Times notes will  keep Mr. Comey at the center of the F.B.I. s investigation into several Trump associates and their potential ties with the Russian government. Comey demonstrated with his attacks on Hillary that he has absolutely no integrity whatsoever, which makes him exactly the sort of guy Trump would want to keep around. Also on Tuesday, purely by coincidence of course, news broke that Trump s national security adviser was cleared of any wrongdoing in his frantic communications with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak on the same day President Obama announced sanctions against Russia for their cyberattack on our nation during the election.White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who also says that Trump had the most heavily-witnessed inauguration in history, and for whom Kellyanne Conway created a new term,  alternative facts,  in an effort to normalize his lies, explained Monday that the two aren t in frequent contact but have spoken recently on a number of issues that were completely innocent, like logistics for a post-inauguration call between Trump and his Russian dictator friend who 17 intelligence agencies say directly interfered with our election on The Donald s behalf.The problem here is that Americans cannot be sure if the presented results are legitimate, as the FBI is headed by someone who went out of his way, breaking precedent and probably the law, to aid Trump in the election with misleading information about Clinton. This same man was just rewarded for his actions when Trump allowed him to keep his job. But Trump also has the power to fire him if he isn t satisfied with the results of any of the numerous investigations into his team.In November, Trump said that Comey  made a mistake  when he announced that Hillary Clinton had committed no crimes and would not be charged, but  brought back his reputation  when he released the letter that gave right-wing propaganda outlets (and Putin s team of propagandists) much-needed ammo just before the election.So now, we as Americans are presented with a dilemma: Do we accept the words of the FBI, knowing that Trump can fire the person in charge of the investigations, when he is someone who has shown a corrupt desire to interfere in important things like elections in the past? Or do we demand a full release of investigatory documents and transcripts just to be sure the truth is being told?Probably better to be safe about this.Featured image by Andrew Harrer via Getty Images ",0

1102,"When Trump began his disinformation campaign and then started trying to muzzle federal agencies, employees of some of these agencies went to Twitter to openly defy him. They call themselves AltGov, and there are dozens of these accounts that are making a point of pushing out the very facts that Trump wishes would disappear, as well as openly fighting his  alternative facts,  and overall disinformation campaign. Many have been verified by Snopes, who now keeps a running list of trusted AltGov accounts.However, no matter who they are, they are all very clear about the fact that they are not doing this on behalf of their agencies. They re operating these accounts independently and are not official U.S. government Twitter accounts, and they re dedicated to maintaining the flow of information from the government to the people that we enjoyed under previous administrations (Please note: Their work does not appear to include any sensitive information, and they appear to be very careful to keep it that way).Below are some of the agencies and departments where members of AltGov work, have inside knowledge of, or can otherwise speak the truth about what the government is doing:There are also two alternate accounts dedicated to sending out facts under the name Alt. Sarah H. Sanders (@altUSPressSec), and Alt. Alt. Press Sec (@altaltPressSec). In addition to directly and loudly calling out the Trump administration on its lies, Alt. Alt. Press Sec  speaks truth to power for those who block @altUSPressSec,  who has been blocked by none other than Trump himself. Back when Sean Spicer was still Trump s press secretary, @altUSPressSec tweeted out a short description of what AltGov stands for.We are not scientists. We are civil servants and Federal contractors united for the preservation of democratic norms. We support our #altGov  Alt. Sean Spicer (@AltUSPressSec) January 26, 2017This is an anti-Trump resistance movement within the United States government that caught on like a wildfire in a forest canopy shortly after he decided to muzzle the Department of the Interior and the National Park Service back in January. There are also many, many supporting accounts who aren t government, but who support the movement and have ways to help. What we see here is the backbone of the federal government, along with concerned contractors and friends, telling Trump to fuck right the hell off with his  alternative facts  and muzzling bullshit. They will not be silenced.Featured image by Andrew Harrer via Getty Images",0
19,"If Donald Trump and his team are trying to pretend that everything is fine and nothing s wrong, they re not doing a very good job.Earlier today, Trump kicked off the morning by indulging in his habitual Twitter habit whenever he s nervous about something. Providing a distraction from former FBI Director James Comey s testimony, Trump decided to announce his pick for a new FBI Director   signaling that Trump is nervous as hell and desperate to take the heat off the Russia scandal. It turns out, his Vice President is also freaking out.Apparently, Mike Pence reacted to the release of Comey s opening statement by abruptly cancelling a scheduled interview   literally right before it was supposed to happen! Now, Pence is cowering and has gone into hiding. Here s what went down, according to PBS:Pence bailed with no warning whatsoever!Comey s released opening statement has clearly taken the White House by surprise, and everyone s in panic mode now. The White House has been on media lockdown since the release of the statement, and Pence s response surely raised suspicions.Pence, without a doubt, cancelled that interview so he wouldn t have to answer questions about Comey   because he could not only further incriminate Trump, but himself as well. Despite the fact that most of the focus has been on Trump, Pence is also in big trouble because of the Russia scandal. Trump s entire administration is in danger if he goes down.What happens tomorrow during Comey s testimony will likely change the entire direction of the Russia scandal, and it already looks as if it is going to mean bad news for Trump. All of the warning signs and red flags are present, and everyone close to Trump is now running for the hills. For Pence to cancel this interview certainly means something fishy is happening, and most of us can t wait to find out.Featured image via Alex Wong / Getty Images",0

1058,"Trump s Department of Education is delaying action on requests for student loan forgiveness from those whose money was stolen by the scams that are for-profit universities while they work to erase everything Obama tried to do to protect those very same students. The Trump administration, while claiming they re  draining the swamp,  has brought more of the swamp into the federal government than anyone, and the people working at DOE are sympathetic to these scam universities, not their victims.It s true that a lack of action isn t the same as telling students defrauded by these places that they ll have to continue making their payments or face the consequences. However, that same lack of action is harming students and their families who are on the hook for loans they took out on false promises they d be able to get good jobs with their degrees. They re now stuck in a limbo that s teetering towards the for-profit education scam.Corinthian Colleges and ITT Technical Institute both closed their doors under President Obama, who forgave more than $600 million in loans to their students. That s $600 million in stolen money for which students were off the hook. But that was Obama, who tried to do things that helped ordinary Americans even in the face of unprecedented GOP obstruction. Trump and his administration?Everything they do favors the few over the many, even when it includes stealing, which is what misrepresenting yourself and taking people s money based on that misrepresentation is.Trump himself has been sued more than once over his fraudulent  Trump University  because that program was literally nothing but lies built upon lies. Trump U. took people s money and gave them nothing in return. Other for-profit universities promise students jobs in their fields within just a few months of graduation, but charge exorbitant tuition and have a history of forcing students to forfeit their right to sue as well as making promises they can t back up.Obama tried to eliminate the arbitration clauses for-profit universities were forcing on their students. Betsy DeVos, Trump s education secretary, says that students shouldn t be the victims of fraud, but also said that certain standards protecting students were unfairly applied.So DOE is allegedly working to change that. But since Trump himself operated a scam university, it s only natural that he and his administration are going to see the profit side of things more than they will the defrauded-student side of things. Fraud is nothing more than another way to put dollars in their pockets, and it s clear that they d rather help scams rake in even more money than help real people.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",0
278,"Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has just sent the Trump campaign a message that is going to make them furious, especially coming from one of the largest investment banks in the country.Recently, the bank banned all of its top officials from donating to Trump s campaign   which is kind of hilarious considering how much Trump s campaign is struggling. In a memo right now, the bank instructed its highest ranking employees: Effective Thursday, September 1, all partners across the firm are considered  restricted persons  as defined by the firm s Policy on Personal Political Activities in the US. As outlined below, restricted persons are prohibited from engaging in political activities and/or making campaign contributions to candidates running for state and local offices, as well as sitting state and local officials running for federal office.The policy change is meant to prevent inadvertently violating pay-to-play rules, particularly the look-back provision, when partners transition into roles covered by these rules. The penalties for failing to comply with these rules can be severe and include fines and a ban on the firm from doing business with government clients in a particular jurisdiction for a period of at least two years.The policy change is also meant to minimize potential reputational damage caused by any false perception that the firm is attempting to circumvent pay-to-play rules, particularly given partners  seniority and visibility. All failures to pre-clear political activities as outlined below are taken seriously and violations may result in disciplinary action. Damn! And to make this even more brilliant, Goldman Sachs SPECIFICALLY called out the Trump campaign when they described the types of donations that are banned: any federal candidate who is a sitting state or local official (e.g., governor running for president or vice president, such as the Trump/Pence ticket, or mayor running for Congress), including their Political Action Committees (PACs). TwitterTwitterThe interesting thing here is that both Trump and Clinton s running mates hold a position in a political office   yet only Trump s VP pick, Indiana governor Mike Pence, is mentioned. To make matters even worse, these rules don t restrict donations to Clinton s campaign because Kaine is a U.S. Senator for Virginia and not considered a local official according to Goldman Sachs  rules (although the memo does say employees cannot donate to the Virginia Democratic party).Although Goldman Sachs  CEO hasn t officially said who he is voting for, it s public knowledge that he s a long-time Clinton fan, and had donated to her campaign when she ran against Obama in 2008.You can read the full memo here, as obtained by Fortune.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images",0

They can see what has happened in other places.    Salesman for alarm systems.Since Parliament decided in 1975 that Sweden should be multicultural and not Swedish, crime has exploded. Violent crime has increased by over 300% and rapes have increased by an unbelievable 1,472%.The violence at the hands of Muslim migrants  is nothing new to Sweden. This horrific video was published in 2013:Many Swedes see the mass immigration as a forced marriage: Sweden is forced to marry a man she did not choose, yet she is expected to love and honor him, even though he beats her and treats her badly. Her parents (the government) tell her to be warm and show solidarity with him. Are the State and I now in agreement that our mutual contract is being renegotiated?    Alexandra von Schwerin, whose farm who was robbed three times. Police refused to help.Once upon a time, there was a safe welfare state called Sweden, where people rarely locked their doors.Now, this country is a night-watchman state   each man is on his own. When the Minister of Justice, Morgan Johansson, encourages breaking the law, it means opening the gates to anarchy. Mr. and Mrs. Swede have every reason to be worried, with the influx of 190,000 unskilled and unemployed migrants expected this year   equivalent to 2% of Sweden s current population. The number is as if 6.4 million penniless migrants who did not speak English arrived in U.S. in one year, or 1.3 million in Britain.And the Swedes are preparing: demand for firearms licenses is increasing; more and more Swedes are joining shooting clubs and starting vigilante groups. After a slight dip in 2014, the number of new gun permits has gone up significantly again this year. According to police statistics, there are 1,901,325 licensed guns, owned by 567,733 people, in Sweden. Add to this an unknown number of illegal weapons. To get a gun permit in Sweden, you need to be at least 18 years old; law-abiding; well-behaved, and have a hunting license or be a member of an approved shooting club. In 2014, 11,000 people got a hunting license: 10% more than the year before. One out of five was a woman. There is also a high demand for alarm systems right now,  says a salesman at one of the security companies in an interview with Gatestone. It is largely due to the turbulence we are seeing around the country at the moment.  People have lost confidence in the State, he added.  The police will not come anymore. Truck drivers say that when they see a thief emptying the fuel tank of their trucks, they run out with a baseball bat. It is no use calling the police, but if you hit the thief, you can at least prevent him from stealing more diesel. Many homeowners say the same thing: they sleep with a baseball bat under the bed. But this is risky: the police can then say you have been prepared to use force, and that might backfire on you. The salesman, who asked to remain anonymous, also spoke of Sweden s many Facebook groups, in which people in different villages openly discuss how they intend to protect themselves:  Sometimes you get totally freaked out when you see what they are writing. But you have to understand that Swedes are really scared when an asylum house opens in their village. They can see what has happened in other places. One blog, detailing the consequences for the local population when an asylum facility opens, is aptly named Asylkaos ( Asylum Chaos ). There is a list of companies the reader is prompted to boycott; the blog claims these businesses encourage the transformation of Sweden to a multicultural society, and are therefore considered  hostile to Swedes. At another security company, a salesman said that every time the Immigration Service buys or rents a new housing facility, his firm is swamped with calls.  The next day,  he said,  half the village calls and wants to buy alarm systems. Ronny Fredriksson, spokesman of the security company Securitas, said that the demand for home alarm systems first exploded about six years ago, when many local police stations were shut down and police moved to the main towns. This, he said, could result in response times of several hours.  More and more people now employ the services of our security guards. Shopping malls and stores in the city come together and hire guards. We are kind of like the  local beat  cops of old. Even though Securitas makes big money from the increased need for home security alarms and security guards, Fredriksson says they also are worried about the effect on society: The problem is that we too need the police. When our guards catch a burglar or a violent person, we call the police but the response times are often very long. Sometimes, the detainees get violent and quite rowdy. On occasion, the police have told us to release the person we have apprehended, if we have his identity, because they do not have a patrol nearby. Even before the massive influx of migrants in the fall of 2015, Swedes felt a need to protect themselves   and with good reason. Since the Parliament decided in 1975 that Sweden should be multicultural and not Swedish, crime has exploded. Violent crime has increased by more than 300%, and rapes have increased by an unbelievable 1,472%.The politicians, however, ignore the people s fear completely. It is never discussed. Instead, the people who express concern about what kind of country Sweden has become are accused of xenophobia and racism. Most likely, that is the reason more and more people are taking matters into their own hands, and protecting themselves and their families to the best of their ability.All the same, some people do not settle for that. It seems some people are trying to stop mass immigration to Sweden. Almost every day there are reports of fires being set at asylum houses. So far, miraculously, no one has been hurt.These fires are set not only by Swedes. On October 13, a 36-year-old woman living in Skellefte  was convicted of setting fire to the asylum facility in which she herself resided. The woman claimed she lit a candle and then fell asleep. Yet forensic evidence showed that a combustible fluid had been doused throughout the room, and the court found beyond a reasonable doubt that she herself had ignited the fire.The number of violent incidents at Sweden s Immigration Service facilities is now sky-high. In 2013, according to Dispatch International, at least one incident happened every day. When Gatestone Institute recently acquired the incident list for January 1, 2014 through October 29, 2015, that number had risen to 2,177 incidents of threats, violence and brawls   on average, three per day.The Swedish government, however, would apparently rather not talk about that. Foreign Minister Margot Wallstr m conceded, in an interview with the daily Dagens Nyheter that garnered international attention, that Sweden is, in fact, heading for a systemic breakdown: Most people seem to think we cannot maintain a system where perhaps 190,000 people will arrive every year. In the long run, our system will collapse. This welcome is not going to receive popular support. We want to give people who come here a worthy reception. Symptomatic of Swedish journalists, this statement was tucked away at the end of the article. The headline was about how the political party that is critical of immigration, the Sweden Democrats Party (Sverigedemokraterna), is responsible for the asylum-housing fires. But foreign media, such as The Daily Mail and Russia Today, picked up Wallstr m s warning about a systemic collapse and ran it as the urgent news it actually is.Nevertheless, in official Sweden, the imminent collapse is ignored. Instead, journalists exclusively focus on attacks by supposedly  racist  Swedes on refugee centers. To prevent new fires, the Immigration Service decided on October 28 that from now on, all asylum facilities would have secret addresses. And meager police resources will now be stretched even further   to protect asylum seekers. Police helicopters will even patrol refugee centers. But considering there are only five helicopters available, and that Sweden s landmass is 407,340 square km (157,274 square miles), this gesture is effectively empty.At a meeting with the Nordic Council in Reykjavik, Iceland, on October 27, Sweden s Prime Minister, Stefan L fven, was questioned by his Nordic colleagues about the situation in Sweden. L fven had recently said that,  We should have the option of relocating people applying for asylum in Sweden to other EU-countries. Our ability, too, has a limit. We are facing a paradigm shift.  That comment led a representative of Finland s Finns Party (Sannfinl ndarna) to wonder, with a hint of irony, how mass immigration to Sweden, which for years Swedish politicians have touted as being so profitable, has now suddenly become a burden.Another Finns Party representative, Simon Elo, pointed out that the situation in Sweden is out of control.  Sweden has great abilities, but not even the Swedes have abilities that great,  Elo said.When L fven was asked how he is dealing with the real concerns and demands of the citizenry, his answer was laconic:  Of course I understand there is concern,  L fven said.  It is not easy. But at the same time   there are 60 million people on the run. This is also about them being our fellow men, and I hope that viewpoint will prevail. The daily tabloid Expressen asked L fven about the attacks on asylum facilities. He replied,  Our communities should not be characterized by threats and violence, they should be warm and show solidarity. As if such behavior can be forced.Many Swedes see mass immigration as a forced marriage: Sweden is forced to marry a man she did not choose, yet she is expected to love and honor him even though he beats her and treats her badly. And on top of that, her parents (the government) tell her to be warm and show solidarity with him.More and more Swedish commentators are now drawing the same conclusion: that Sweden is teetering on the brink of collapse. Editorial columnist Ivar Arpi of the daily Svenska Dagbladet, wrote an astonishing article on October 26, about a woman named Alexandra von Schwerin and her husband. The couple lives on the Skarhults Estate farm in Sk ne in southern Sweden; they have been robbed three times. Most recently, they were robbed of a quad bike, a van and a car. When the police arrived, von Schwerin asked them what she should do. The police told her that they could not help her.  All our resources are on loan to the asylum reception center in Trelleborg and Malm ,  they said.  We are overloaded right now. So I suggest you get in touch with the vigilante group in Esl v. What the police had called a  vigilante group  turned out to be a group of private business owners. In 2013, after being robbed more or less every night, they had decided to come together and start patrolling the area themselves. Currently, they pay a security firm to watch their facilities. On principal, I am totally against it,  von Schwerin said.  What are the people who cannot afford private security to do? They will be unprotected. I m sure I will join, but very, very reluctantly. For the first time, I feel scared to live here now. Are the State and I now in agreement that our mutual contract is being renegotiated? Commenting on the police s encouraging people to join vigilante groups, social commentator and former Refugee Ombudsman Merit Wager wrote: So, the Swedes are supposed to arrange and pay for their own and their families  security and keep their farms from being subjected to theft, even though that has up to now been included in the social contract   for which we pay high taxes, to have police we can count on to protect us and apprehend criminals?! When did the social contract expire? October 2015? Without any notice of termination, since the tax-consuming party is not fulfilling its part of the deal? This should mean that our part of the deal   to pay taxes for public, joint services   has also become invalid? If the social contract is broken, it is broken. Then it is musical chairs (lawlessness, defenselessness, without protection), and that means that each and every one of us should pay less taxes. Ilan Sad , lawyer and social commentator, wrote about the refugee chaos at Malm  Central Train Station on the blog Det Goda Samh llet on October 27:  The authorities no longer honor the social contract.  He described four large signs on display around the station that read  Refugee? Welcome to Malm !  in four different languages. It is unclear who the sender of the message is, or, for that matter, who is in charge of the reception facility   a number of barracks by the old post office in the inner harbor. Everything is utterly confusing. It could be Malm  City or the Immigration Service, but it might as well be  Refugees Welcome,  or possibly a religious community. I think to myself that a government agency could not reasonably write like this, a correct and pertinent sign would say something like:  Asylum seekers are referred to the barracks for information and further transport.  But I am probably wrong; Malm  City is the chief suspect communicant.   The signs in and around the Central Station are symptoms of something incredibly serious: Role confusion and the decay of the constitutional state. And thus, that our authorities no longer honor the social contract. In a post called Anarchy, blogger Johan Westerholm, who is a Social Democratic Party member and a critic of the government, wrote that the Minister for Justice and Migration, Morgan Johansson, is now urging authorities to  be pragmatic  about laws and regulations (concerning asylum housing for so-called unaccompanied refugee children). Westerholm stated that this is tantamount to the government  opening the gates to anarchy : Our country is founded on law; Parliament legislates and the courts apply these. Morgan Johansson s statement and his otherwise passive approach are testimony to how this, our kind of democracy, may fade into a memory very shortly. He now laid the first brick in the building of a state that rests on other principles. Anarchism. If anarchy really does break out, it would be good to remember that there are nearly two million licensed firearms in Sweden. Sweden s shooting clubs have seen a surge in interest; many are welcoming a lot of new members lately. Via: Gatestone Institute",0

1051,"After more than 20 years of service within the National Guard, First Sgt. Dennis Carter submitted his resignation, effective May 31, 2016. In the letter, Carter shreds what he describes as the  toxic leadership  that exists at the 278th Armored Cavalry Regiment, located in Lebanon, TN.The now-retired First Sergeant directed his anger at his superior officers, writing that the Senior NCO s leadership abilities are so substandard  I doubt he could lead a pack of Kindergartners to the playground, nor would they follow him. He also had harsh words for others, including a Colonel. Carter wrote that his  leadership style is so toxic that his social security number should be replaced with the telephone number of the poison control center The former Sgt. didn t just submit the resignation letter to his superiors, he posted it on social media as well.WSMV published a redacted version of Carter s letter on June 24. Read it for yourself below.Image credit WSMV via Dennis CarterCarter is not the first one to criticize or question the leadership of Tennessee-based National Guardsmen.The U.S. military launched a criminal investigation into sexual misconduct involving the 775th Engineering Detachment. The investigation involved allegations that at least half of the Guardsmen had sexual relations with  prostitutes  in an area of the world which was known for sex trafficking.The investigation revealed that many of the girls the Guardsmen had sex with were under the age of 18.As WSMV reports here:The military documents show a lieutenant said there were ring leaders who told the soldiers what to say and how to stay out of trouble.Another soldier told investigators that some of the men bragged about the sex and that a medic handed out condoms.When the soldiers were later interviewed, the documents show one sergeant made a spontaneous statement that  several of the women (referring to the prostitutes) were younger than his daughter. The investigation also revealed that some of the soldiers allowed the  prostitutes  to enter a room with weapons and secret documents.A second investigation was opened after authorities found evidence of drug use by at least one of the soldiers.In February, WSMV reported that the Tennessee National Guard promotes individuals who have engaged in serious misconduct violations. Video published here shows two Guardsmen being pulled over by the TN Highway Patrol for DUI. These men should have been removed from duty, but were promoted instead.During an interview with WSMV, Carter blasted TN National Guard Leadership, saying: I m out, so I don t have anything to lose. But there are a lot of people that are still in and there s a lot of horror stories that have been done badly by the leadership in the guard. Watch the interview below, courtesy of WSMV.

She claimed that the U.S. had never gone as long without a Treasury Secretary as we did with Trump. She made up an entire terrorist attack. She said that microwaves turn into cameras. And somehow, people still want to talk to her.Some in the press have started seeing her as  the darkness,  because she s such a purveyor of misinformation. That word,  darkness,  refers to the Washington Post s front page motto,  Democracy dies in darkness.  Michael Wolff, a reporter for the Hollywood Reporter, told her: I m going to tell you, when they say  democracy dies in darkness,  you re the darkness. So the Washington Post (and Wolff) is calling her and other purveyors of lies out in their front-page motto. Conway s response was to first say,  I m not the darkness! Then she said: It s what I tell small children: Just because somebody says something doesn t make it true, and it s a great lesson for everyone. Miss Bowling Green Massacre is defending herself against accusations of lies by pointing out that people lie. The irony! It hurts!

347,"Breaking news out of Trump s White House indicates that marijuana use may have contributed to the violent events at Bowling Green and perhaps even in Sweden.At least, in the opinion of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, that could be the case. Despite repeated promises by Trump on the campaign trail to leave states alone that have legalized recreational cannabis, the Trump administration appears to be gearing up to take aim at the legal marijuana industry. On Monday, he told reporters at the Justice Department that  real violence  is connected to cannabis use:Sessions further said that experts have told him there is  more violence around marijuana,  than one would think. You can t sue somebody for a drug debt,  Sessions said, on Monday.  The only way to get your money is through strong-arm tactics, and violence tends to follow that. (Business Insider) I don t think America is going to be a better place when people of all ages, and particularly young people, are smoking pot,  Sessions said.  I believe it s an unhealthy practice, and current levels of THC in marijuana are very high compared to what they were a few years ago, and we re seeing real violence around that. If he was just a tiny bit smarter, he d realize he s actually arguing in favor of legalization. I live in Portland, Oregon. Here s a couple of notes about the recreational dispensary located a convenient four blocks from my house   first, they are a small business. Small businesses aren t in the habit of fronting people inventory; you typically pay for what you re purchasing, and leave. The second point here is going to require a bit of imagination.Let s imagine that they have fronted me untold amounts of cannabis, and I haven t paid. So they send a strongman to my house to get the money and I just call the cops, because weed is legal, I m not incriminating myself by calling, and using  strong-arm tactics  to get money you are owed is illegal. Federal courts aren t going to treat it as a legitimate product, sure, but the answer to that is complete legalization, not wasting millions of dollars in pointless enforcement and court battles with individual states.He said some other genuinely dumb shit as well:Sessions then appeared to criticize a column The Washington Post published Tuesday by Sam Kamin, professor of marijuana law and policy at the University of Denver. In the op-ed, Kamin argues that the opioid crisis is  a reason to expand access to marijuana rather than to contract it.  A 2016 study from Columbia University s Mailman School of Public Health found  adverse consequences of opioid use  decreased over time in states where marijuana is legalized as individuals substituted marijuana for opioids to treat pain.But Sessions scoffed at Kamin s reasoning. Give me a break,  Sessions said.  This is the kind of argument that has been out there. [It s] almost a desperate attempt to defend the harmlessness of marijuana or even benefits. I doubt that s true. Maybe science will prove me wrong.   My best view is that we don t need to be legalizing marijuana. Well, Sessions, science has, indeed, proved you wrong. Your  best view  is both behind the times and demonstrably false. There is so much information out there demonstrating the benefits of cannabis in combating the opiate epidemic and treating chronic pain that if you re the Attorney General, and ignorant of it, it s by choice.It s time for the failed war on drugs to draw to a close. All prohibition of cannabis accomplishes is driving people who self-medicate or are prescribed cannabis for chronic pain to use prescription opiates instead, finances the cartels and fuels violence, and makes the Fox News crowd happy. The  gateway drug  shtick is old and false. Sean Spicer and Jeff Sessions think that increased recreational use of cannabis has led to the opiate epidemic, rather than excessive and improper prescriptions (as evidence shows). This is so wrong and out-of-touch that it shows they have no interest in  actually helping or rehabilitating heroin and oxy addicts   they are only interested in using them as a political prop that justifies attacking rights they don t believe people should have. So much for  small government,  eh?Featured image via Zach Gibson/Getty Images",0

1050,"The Supreme Court sided with women on freedom and the right to choose today with their ruling on Texas  restrictive abortion law. In a 5-3 ruling, they said that the arguments that the law merely protects women s health are actually just a substantial burden on women seeking abortions. Since abortion is a constitutional right, no matter what the right-wing thinks, Texas  law was deemed unconstitutional.Justice Stephen Breyer wrote the majority opinion, and said: There was no significant health-related problem that the new law helped to cure. We agree with the District Court that the surgical-center requirement, like the admitting-privileges requirement, provides few, if any, health benefits for women, poses a substantial obstacle to women seeking abortions, and constitutes an  undue burden  on their constitutional right to do so. He was joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Anthony Kennedy, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. Ginsburg wrote her own concurring opinion, where she said: When a State severely limits access to safe and legal procedures, women in desperate circumstances may resort to unlicensed rogue practitioners, faute de mieux, at great risk to their health and safety. The 5-3 decision isn t just a victory for women and women s rights, but it also shows that the Supreme Court would have struck the law down even with a full bench, and a staunch conservative in Scalia s place. Anybody who thinks that a full bench would have stopped this is living in Fantasyland.Even so, anti-choice conservatives are still busy trying to convince people that the law actually protected women. Nothing could be further from the truth, which is why this case went all the way to the Supreme Court. Yet, here they are, in all their righteous anger about it, claiming that today is a sad day for women all across the country.Texas Governor Greg Abbott said (all emphasis from The New York Times): The decision erodes states  lawmaking authority to safeguard the health and safety of women, and subjects more innocent life to being lost. Texas  goal is to protect innocent life while ensuring the highest health and safety standards for women. Senator John Cornyn seems to agree with that. He said: Today s ruling sets a dangerous precedent for states like Texas, which the Constitution makes clear should be free to pass laws that are in the best interests of our citizens. Common-sense requirements that abortion clinics be held to the same standards as other medical facilities put the health of the patient first, and today s decision is a step back in protecting the well-being of mothers across our state. You two just keep telling yourselves that.Of course, National Right To Life can always be counted on to provide total ignorance masquerading as sane, logical reasoning on the issue of abortion: How shabby are these abortion clinics that they cannot meet the minimum standards other outpatient surgical centers are required to meet, and just how bad are these abortionists that they can t get admitting privileges at a local hospital? As we saw with Kermit Gosnell in Philadelphia, it s clear that the lucrative abortion industry is not able or willing to police itself and allows filthy, deplorable conditions to go unchecked. Ah, yes, invoking Kermit Gosnell, as if he s the norm and abortion doctors who are actually ethical and competent are the exception. Don t they have more evidence than that? Oh, wait, no they don t. One case is more than enough for them to think they can justify destroying a woman s right to choose what she does with her own body.Over on Twitter, many are celebrating this as the victory for women it is, but there are still anti-choicers rearing their ugly heads with the same twisted logic, spinning this as a grave mistake endangering thousands of women. Or they re making the argument that this violates states  rights (or doing both).

612,"Some of the biggest corporations in the United States have come together to beg Donald Trump not to abandon the Paris Climate Agreement and they did it on the front page of the New York Times. Dear President Trump,  they began.  As some of the largest companies based or operating in the United States, we strongly urge you to keep the United States in the Paris Agreement on climate change. Climate change presents both business risks and business opportunities,  the open letter to Trump explained.  Continued U.S. participation in the agreement benefits U.S. businesses and the U.S. economy in many ways.  These include  strengthening competitiveness,  creating jobs, markets, and growth,  and  reducing business risks,   the letter added, going into each point in detail.The letter was signed by several of the biggest companies in America, including Adobe, Apple, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Danfoss, Facebook, Gap, Inc., Google, The Hartford, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, Ingersoll Rand, Intel Corporation, Johnson Controls, Levi Strauss & Co., Mars Incorporated, Microsoft, Morgan Stanley, National Grid, PG&E Corporation, Royal DSM, Salesforce, Schneider Electric, Tiffany & Co., Unilever, and VF Corporation all signed on to the open plea.The letter was also published in several other major newspapers throughout the country. As businesses concerned with the well-being of our customers, our investors, our communities, and our suppliers, we are strengthening our climate resilience, and we are investing in innovative technologies that can help achieve a clean energy transition. For this transition to succeed, however, governments must lead as well,  the coporations said to Trump. U.S. business is best served by a stable and practical framework facilitating an effective and balanced global response. The Paris Agreement provides such a framework. As other countries invest in advanced technologies and move forward with the Paris Agreement, we believe the United States can best exercise global leadership and advance U.S. interests by remaining a full partner in this vital global effort,  the letter concluded.Trump has gone back and forth on whether or not to pull the United States out of the climate deal. Axios announced that it was a done deal and Trump would be withdrawing from the agreement. But the New York Times reported on Tuesday that Trump is once again on the fence about the matter and has been influenced by the negative response from big businesses urging him not to abandon the deal.Featured image via Olivier Douliery   Pool/Getty Images",0

815,"Who knew that Donald Trump would humiliate himself and us as soon as humanly possible with his trip to Asia? There was really no way to know that   this is one of the smartest men on the planet oh wait. This is Donald Trump. And in discussing North Korea s decision to fire ballistic missiles over Japan, he wondered why Japan didn t just shoot those missiles down.That, in turn, shows a complete and total lack of knowledge about how missiles work, about even our own military s capabilities, and about the optics of such an endeavor on ours and Japan s part. First off, it would have been extremely difficult for Japan to shoot them down due to their altitude and speed. Japan does have missile interceptors, but North Korea s missiles were very likely out of range.Then there are the optics: Japan would have been embarrassed alongside us. Our own capabilities to shoot down missiles are also limited, and tests on both systems have failed consistently. Watching us and Japan embarrass ourselves would have emboldened North Korea because it would have told them that we can t stop their missiles. An emboldened North Korea is the last thing the world needs right now.But that s not all. Trump also insulted all of Japan by saying that he couldn t understand why a country full of samurai warriors wouldn t want to shoot down North Korea s missiles. While the samurai are a part of Japan s long and rich history, Trump calling them  a nation of samurai warriors  just reinforces the rest of the world s belief that Americans are too stupid and too arrogant to bother learning about anyone else, and would rather just fall back on ethnic stereotypes.These remarks took place well before Trump actually headed to Japan; however, the news of it came out as he was en route. So, just like every other international trip on which the walking racist presidential impostor has gone, we have been embarrassed on the world stage.

944,"It was just this morning that Donald Trump once again tried to ignore his mounting failures and pump up his ego by trashing the press. Taking to Twitter, the undeserving POTUS bashed the New York Times (again) with yet another one of his lies. And after Trump trashed the New York Times, he posted another tweet about the  vicious  and inaccurate media:If the people of our great country could only see how viciously and inaccurately my administration is covered by certain media!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2017However, thanks to a new poll released by Monmouth University, Trump s temper tantrums about the press are far from over, because he seems to be alone in his opinion. The Monmouth University poll revealed that thanks to Trump s numerous lies and falsehoods, Americans now view MSNBC as a more credible source than him!You can only imagine how devastating it is for Trump to realize that his attacks on  fake news  are actually working against him and HELPING networks that dare to publish the truth about him. The poll stated: Only 28% of Americans are more likely trust Trump as an information source compared to ABC news while most (53%) say they would tend to trust ABC more, with 15% saying they would trust both sides equally. When pitted against MSNBC, 33% trust Trump more while 47% trust the liberal leaning cable channel more, with 15% trusting both about equally. When pitted against Fox News, only 17% trust Trump more while 37% trust the politically conservative news outlet more, with 36% trusting both about equally. Another interesting but not surprising finding from the poll was the fact that networks like MSNBC and ABC were viewed as more credible than Fox News, which has previously been outed as the most dishonest network (which is likely why Trump cites them so much). The only area where Trump is actually succeeding in credibility is among Republicans, who tend to take Trump s nonsense as the truth. The poll reported: The story is different, though, when isolating the views of Republicans. Americans who identify as GOP partisans are more likely to have confidence in Trump over any of the news sources tested in the poll. This is especially true for MSNBC   Trump is more trusted by a 66% to 16% margin   and ABC News   Trump is more trusted by a 56% to 22% margin. The president even has a slight, although statistically insignificant, 29% to 26% trust advantage over Fox News among his fellow partisans, with 44% of Republicans saying they trust both equally as an information source. So, Trump basically screwed himself over by trying to damage the credibility of the free press. While it s somewhat satisfying to see his attacks on the media backfire, we must not forget that what Trump s ridiculous behavior has resulted in is extremely dangerous. The White House now has no credibility, which could be devastating in the event that something serious happens.

In addition to having gigantic hands (the most giganticestest in the world, no less!), a huge dong (you can see it from space), and a daughter he totally doesn t want to sleep with (or does he?), Donald Trump has managed to pick up a new ally: an old white dude who can control the weather!In his effort to pander to evangelicals, Trump has enlisted the aid of Frank Amedia, a televangelist who blames AIDS on  unnatural sex  who entered into a conspiracy to fix a court case for a friend in 2001. He s also able to control the weather through the power of Jesus, or something.Amedia, who now serves as the billionaire s liaison for Christian policy,  claims that he personally saved his daughter from disaster when an earthquake off the coast of Japan sent a tsunami to a Hawaiian island on which his precious little snowflake was staying. Thanks to the power of prayer and an ego large enough to think that an omnipotent being would even notice him, let alone do him a solid, Trump s  God guy  says he was able to talk his BFF into stopping the tsunami just off the shore of the island. I stood at the edge of my bed and I said,  In the name of Jesus, I declare that tsunami to stop now,  he says in a video in which he tells the tale of that time he and God went all  X-Men  on that storm.  And I specifically said,  I declare those waters to recede,  and I said,  Father, that is my child, I am your child, I m coming to you now and asking you to preserve her.  Apostle, it was seen by 400 people on a cliff. It was on YouTube, it was actually on the news that that tsunami stopped 200 feet off of shore. Even after having sucked the waters in, it churned and it went on and did devastation in the next island. Interestingly, he seems entirely unconcerned with the people who live on the next island over. Maybe there are limits to God s power and these  Christians  know better than to ask him to do more than save their own skins.Last December, a Texas woman also exhibited this strange weather control power. Sabrina Lowe of Rowlett says she saved her family s lives when she asked God to redirect a tornado to a neighboring town. Apparently, God listened. Lowe s family was spared, but the tornado went on to kill an additional eight people. While little is known about these rare superhuman powers, it seems that weather control thus far has a rather limited scope. Further study is needed.Watch Amedia talk about his weather control capabilities below:Featured image via screengrab",0
530,"Anthony Scaramucci got his ass handed to him on Sunday morning by CNN host Jake Tapper.Just a day has gone by since Scaramucci became the White House communications director, resulting in the resignation of Sean Spicer as press secretary a mere six months into Trump s presidency, and he is already insisting that the Russians did not interfere with the 2016 Election just because Trump said so.That s despite our nation s intelligence agencies and former and current intelligence officials confirming otherwise.During a discussion about whether Trump will sign the bipartisan legislation that slaps sanctions on Russia, Scaramucci used an anonymous source to claim that the American people have been misinformed about Russia. There s a lot of disinformation,  Scaramucci said.  Somebody said to me the other day   I don t want to say who   if the Russians actually hacked this situation and spilled out those emails, you would have never seen it. You would have never had any evidence of them. Meaning that they re super confident in their deception skills and hacking. But our intelligence agencies have confirmed that Russian did, in fact, meddle in our election by attacking our democratic institutions by hacking, which can be traced back to the perpetrators by our own professional cyber security experts. Basically, Scaramucci is claiming that the Russians are too good to get caught by us. That s simply not true.And Tapper was quick to call Scaramucci out for it, but not before he slammed Scaramucci for citing an anonymous source. Wait, wait, wait,  Tapper chimed in.  I don t know who this anonymous person is. And then Scaramucci demonstrated that, just like Trump, he can t keep his mouth shut and is a leaker. How about it s the president, Jake,  Scaramucci replied.  He called me from Air Force One and basically said to me,  This is   maybe they did it, maybe they didn t do it. Wow. That s truly pathetic.Tapper proceeded to tear Scaramucci apart for being Trump s yes-man instead of accepting the analysis of our own intelligence agencies and Trump s own Director of National Intelligence. This is exactly the issue!  Tapper said.  We have experts, the U.S. intelligence agencies [are] unanimous, both Obama appointees and Trump appointees   the director of national intelligence, the head of the National Security Agency, the head of the FBI. I mean, all of these intelligence experts, saying, Russia hacked the election, they tried to interfere in the election. President Trump is contradicting it and you re siding with President Trump! Indeed, it certainly appears Scaramucci is just shilling for Trump and he even proceeded to whine about Tapper s observation, leading Tapper to ask,  Don t you owe a duty to the truth? Scaramucci then claimed that he doesn t know what the truth is because:  I don t have the information in front of me. But he didn t even bother to get the information. Instead, he got talking points from Trump and merely parroted them on television like a good little lapdog.Here s the video via YouTube.Scaramucci is already making it clear that he is untrustworthy. He just threw our intelligence community under the bus and demonstrated that he is the kind of leaker that Trump whines about. He couldn t even stop himself from bragging about how Trump himself was the anonymous source who told him Russia didn t hack us. The evidence clearly shows that Russia attacked us and our democratic institutions. Only self-serving fools would believe otherwise. Featured Image: Screenshot",0
97,"Abigail Disney is an heiress with brass ovaries who will profit from the GOP tax scam bill but isn t into f-cking poor people over. Ms. Disney penned an op-ed for USA Today in which she rips the GOP a new one because she has  always been cognizant of income and wealth inequality.  In other words, she is not Donald Trump, Paul Ryan or Bob Corker. Or Mitch McConnell. She is Abigail Disney, dammit. Since the election of Ronald Reagan, the gap between rich and poor has grown dramatically and  trickle down  economics has turned out to cause more of a trickle up,  she writes.  But nothing has brought the problem of inequality into sharper focus for me than the current proposals by Republicans to overhaul the tax system. Disney says that this proposal will be burdensome to the middle class while decreasing  the responsibility of the wealthy to contribute to the common good. And then she dropped a truth bomb. (We like truth bombs.)Republicans insist this plan will cut taxes for the middle class, but the truth is that any meager savings will be offset by losses elsewhere   in deductions no longer allowed, loss of Medicaid and Medicare coverage, and less funding for education, all of which are on the chopping block in order to provide a tax cut for a few very wealthy people like me. There is even a tax break to private jet owners. This bill will give me this tax cut while also killing health insurance for over 13 million people,  Disney wrote.  It will let me pass over $20 million to my children, tax-free. And all my friends with private jets? They get a tax cut too. With a suffocating education system, a dying infrastructure and a national debt that will be at least $1.5 trillion bigger, that social mobility will be far out of reach for people like you,  Disney continued.  But I will be able to stay comfortably right where I am. Does that strike you as fair? No, it does not, thankyouverymuch. But given how this bill was written, I think it s looking a lot like a nightmare from Pirates of the Caribbean,  Disney wrote.  Have I made you angry yet? I really hope I ve made you angry. You should be. No one who votes for this tax bill will be voting with your life in mind. But you will pay for it.

750,"He may work for Fox Radio but this man deserves a ton of respect for what he just did. At a breaking point with Trump s love affair with the racist blog  The Gateway Pundit,  Fox Radio s Jon Decker openly and vehemently criticized the White House for allowing the website, which panders in fake right-wing conspiracies and racist rhetoric, to attend daily press briefings alongside legitimate news sources.Decker didn t hold back. Pointing directly at The Gateway Pundit s Lucian Wintrich, Decker noted that he and his site  hate blacks, Jews, [and] Hispanics  and don t deserve to be in the room. It was a moment where a reporter finally had enough of Trump s normalization of racism, white Nationalism, and xenophobic outlets like Gateway Pundit and Breitbart.The site s founder, Jim Hoft, is frequently referred to as  the stupidest man on the Internet  for his daily parade of false and idiotic coverage of politics. He has repeatedly ran stories that fail to hold up to even the most basic scrutiny and often deals in wild conspiracies. Trump may like them because they relentlessly suck up to him, but they are despicable liars who deal in misinformation and hate.After Decker called Wintrich out, chaos ensued:Fox News Radio John Decker just loudly told everyone in briefing room that Gateway Pundit is here ""they hate blacks, Jews, Hispanics."" Wild  Adrian Carrasquillo (@Carrasquillo) March 10, 2017He was speaking to Lucian Wintrich. He said it twice, pointing to him, so everyone knew who he was. https://t.co/42njWQQ0fX  Adrian Carrasquillo (@Carrasquillo) March 10, 2017Needless to say, Wintrich saw things differently. On Twitter, he whined that he was  assaulted  by Decker. Apparently being called a racist is tantamount to a sucker punch for the poor conspiracy theorist. He also (hilariously) misspelled the word  assault  several times, again highlighting the caliber of writer Trump personally gave a seat in the press briefing room.Jon Decker asulted me at today's briefing. @FoxNews   is this behavior something you tolerate over there? He's sick .https://t.co/gzZhhIzOMD pic.twitter.com/ThppoHpRQw  Lucian B. Wintrich (@lucianwintrich) March 10, 2017John Decker also asulted me, pushing me in the break room & then grabbing my arm in the briefing room while shouting that I'm a nazi. https://t.co/RiVM1yYCJv  Lucian B. Wintrich (@lucianwintrich) March 10, 2017Wintrich also said he would be pressing charges against Decker for  assult  and also for harassment   ironic because Trump s campaign manager Corey Lewandowski once claimed it was no big deal when he yanked the arm of a female reporter who had dared to ask Trump a question as he walked out of a rally.In a statement, Decker pointed out that at no point did he  assault  Wintrich, who appears to be lying. Earlier today I had a conversation with a representative from the online publication Gateway Pundit.  The conversation was straightforward and direct. I also informed the full White House pool that this representative was present in the Briefing Room. At no time did I accost or assault this individual. More than a dozen witnesses will attest to this fact. For Trump to be stopped, reporters as well as ordinary citizens need to stand up to the normalization of his descent into racism and xenophobia. Inviting a fear-mongering, disreputable smear merchant like The Gateway Pundit into the White House shows a level of disrespect for the American people that transcends politics. Kudos to Decker for standing up and loudly saying that it s not okay.Featured image via Twitter",0

1132,"Speculation about Vice-President Mike Pence s political aspirations to position himself in Trump s Oval Office chair will likely get another jolt after it was reported that he tapped campaign operative, Nick Ayers, to be his chief of staff.Ayers spent months quietly bending Pence s ear to warn him that Donald Trump s troubles could cause collateral damage and that he needed to take a more aggressive position on a range of issues in order to ensure that he enters the post-Trump era on solid ground, according to two White House officials, Politico reports.There s been a lot of speculation that Pence will run in 2020 if Trump cannot, considering that his boss is plagued with scandals while only on the job for 7 months. Even political satirist Andy Horowitz wrote a piece titled,  Mike Pence considering running for president in 1820. But, President Pence emphatically denied the possibility of a 2020 run.In a statement released by the White House, Pence said Sunday s story in The New York Times  is disgraceful and offensive to me, my family, and our entire team.  He added that  the allegations in this article are categorically false. However, just before Anthony Scarmucci was kicked of Trump Island as the White House communications director, he suggested to New Yorker writer Ryan Lizza that the Vice-President can t believe what s going on with his boss. Why do you think Nick s there, bro?  Scaramucci told Lizza in an interview last month, shortly before being fired.  Are you stupid? Why is Nick there? Nick s there to protect the Vice-President because the Vice-President can t believe what the f*ck is going on. On top of that, Pence is headed to Latin America after requesting to secure 700 visas for his team.A diplomatic source called the number of visas  curious  because it dwarfed even the advance teams for President Barack Obama s trip to Brazil, Chile and El Salvador combined in 2011.But yeah, he s totally not preparing to sit in the Oval Office. Nope. Not at all. How long will it take before Trump lashes out at his Vice-President? We re pretty sure he cannot fire Pence. Another question: How much does/did Pence know about the Russia scandal as it happened? He might be a bigoted jerkface but he s not stupid.Whatever you do, do NOT tweet Donald Trump to ask about President Pence.

Because we were being penalized by the WHO, we decided to stop requiring a country of origin on meat. Just to clue you in, here s one of our articles that will make you furious that the meat labels are gone:Yuck! It s bad enough that China had a dog meat festival last week but now this! The USDA just removed the country of origin off of meat but it needs to come back ASAP! If there s meat smuggling going on you really don t know where it originated, but if it s China I would like to make the informed choice not to buy their meat for this reason:Chinese authorities have seized more than 100,000 tonnes of smuggled meat   some of it more than 40 years old, according to state media.The frozen meat, estimated to be worth about  300 million (3bn yuan; $483m), was seized in a nationwide crackdown. It was smelly and I nearly threw up when I opened the door,  an official from Hunan province, where 800 tonnes were seized, told the AFP news agency. Poor standards have made food safety a major concern in China. According to state newspaper the China Daily, officials from Guangxi, a southern region bordering Vietnam, found meat dating back to the 1970s. Thawed several times: Some of the meat seized in Hunan province was found to have been refrozen after thawing out while in transit, according to the reports. Yang Bo, an anti-smuggling official in Hunan province, was quoted as saying food was often transported in ordinary rather than refrigerated vehicles to save money.  So the meat has often thawed out several times before reaching customers,  he said. The Hunan province haul reportedly included beef, chicken feet and duck necks. Authorities believe meat is smuggled into China via neighboring Hong Kong and Vietnam, from countries such as Brazil and India, to sidestep import restrictions. WASHINGTON (AP)   It s now harder to find out where your beef or pork was born, raised and slaughtered.After more than a decade of wrangling, Congress repealed a labeling law last month that required retailers to include the animal s country of origin on packages of red meat. It s a major victory for the meat industry, which had fought the law in Congress and the courts since the early 2000s.Lawmakers said they had no choice but to get rid of the labels after the World Trade Organization repeatedly ruled against them. The WTO recently authorized Canada and Mexico, which had challenged the law, to begin more than $1 billion in economic retaliation against the United States. U.S. exporters can now breathe a sigh of relief,  said Republican Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas, chairman of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee. The longtime opponent of the labels helped add the repeal to a massive year-end spending bill. After the law was passed, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said the government immediately would stop requiring the labels.Consumer groups say the repeal is a disappointment just as consumers are asking for more information on their food packages. Advocates say the labels help people make more informed buying decisions and encourage purchases of American meat.Before repeal, the labels told shoppers that a particular cut of meat was  born in Canada, raised and slaughtered in the United States  or  born, raised and slaughtered in the United States.  Congress first required the labels in 2002 amid fears of mad cow disease from imported cattle. The labels weren t on most packages until 2009, though, due to delays pushed by the meat industry.Repeal became inevitable once the United States lost all its WTO appeals and the retaliation became a possibility. But the consumer groups criticized Congress for repealing the law for ground meat and pork in addition to the fresh cuts of meat that were the subject of WTO concerns.The bill was  a holiday gift to the meatpacking industry from Congress,  complained the advocacy group Food and Water Watch. Meatpackers who buy Mexican cattle were some of the law s most aggressive opponents.The repeal also was a big defeat for lawmakers from northern border states where U.S. ranchers directly compete with Canadian ranchers. Those lawmakers insisted on including the labeling in the 2002 and 2008 farm bills and this year fought to replace it with a voluntary program once the WTO rulings came down. But after years of success, this time they were not able to find enough support.Roger Johnson of the National Farmers Union, which has heavy membership in those states, said the group was  furious  about the repeal. Packers will be able to once again deliberately deceive consumers,  Johnson said.Still, there was some good news for food labeling advocates in the spending bill. Despite an aggressive push by the food industry, lawmakers decided not to add language that would have blocked mandatory labeling of genetically modified ingredients. Also, a provision by Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, would require labeling of genetically modified salmon recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration.The issue is expected to come up again in 2016, with Vermont set to require labeling on genetically modified food this summer.The day the spending bill passed, Vilsack said he would try to help Congress come up with a middle ground on labeling of engineered foods  in a way that doesn t create significant market disruption, while at the same time recognizing consumers  need to know and right to know basic information.

At the same time, it s projected that the increases in premiums for those still with coverage would double and the average premiums for individuals purchased through exchanges or insurers would go up by about 25 percent next year compared to Obamacare, reaching approximately 50 percent in 2020. The repeal bill would also bring an immediate end to uninsured people paying a penalty for their lack of coverage, as well as ending funding for Medicaid further down the line.The report also came to the conclusion that insurers would leave the individual market due to the lack of penalties for the uninsured, mostly in anticipation of more high-cost customers and fewer enrolees. If this were to happen, roughly 50 percent of the nation would reside in areas with no insurers in the individual market by 2020, a number that would increase to around 75 percent by 2026, the result of less pressure on penalties and more on premiums.All we can hope for now is that the Senate will vote against a repeal of Obamacare without a replacement ready to go.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",0
280,"Asher Edelman inspired the character Gordon Gekko in Oliver Stone s 1987 film, Wall Street, played by Michael Douglas. The infamous stockbroker, who made a fortune buying and selling companies in distress, was recently asked on CNBC s Fast Money, who he would endorse for Bernie Sanders. His answer was surprising, but his reasoning is not: Bernie Sanders, no question,  said Edelman. ,  I think it s quite simple again. If you look at something called  velocity of money  That means how much gets spent and turns around. When you have the top one percent getting money, they spend five-ten percent of what they earn. When you have the lower end of the economy getting money, they spend a hundred, or a hundred and ten percent of what they earn. As you ve had a transfer of wealth to the top, and a transfer of income to the top, you have a shrinking consumer base, basically, and you have a shrinking velocity of money. Edelman argued redistributing wealth, especially at the point we are at now with levels of income and wealth inequalities continually growing, is what is best for the economy. Greed and corruption may allow the wealthiest to gain short term profits, but as the middle class disappears and the working class becomes ever burdened, the economy begins to sputter into stagnation.Senator Bernie Sanders  economic policies aren t radical, socialist, or unrealistic. They are simply what is needed to be implemented to fix a broken, rigged economy. Edelman may be a member of the top one percent, but he is intelligent enough to realize trickle down economics doesn t work, and the Republicans who insist on perpetuating economic policies surrounding that myth continue to damage the United States economy.The rich getting richer don t create jobs, customers do. If there aren t any customers to purchase goods and services, such as a middle and working class who earn enough to have disposable income, the economy will falter.Featured image via Addicting Info archives",0
730,"Concerns about Trump s conflict of interest reached a new level with the announcement that the National Park Service is finalizing plans that will give one of his companies $32 million in tax subsidies for the hotel he put in D.C. s Old Post Office building. While it s true that he spent the morning tweeting about getting out of his business entirely, he will very likely get this break, which puts those millions in his pockets, before he actually divests (if he actually divests).Trump, Ivanka, and his two sons together own Trump Old Post Office, LLC., and the tax break comes from the  Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credits  program, which provides breaks to companies and investors that rehab historic properties.Ordinarily, this would be something we might mutter and mumble over, because really, does Trump need a tax credit of any kind? We might have muttered and mumbled a little louder if this had happened before he was elected, too. But now, with him actually being the president-elect, and the Park Service technically working for him even if not officially, there s a major problem.They just gave their new employer a break on his taxes.Trump s lease on the Old Post Office strictly prohibits  any elected official of the Government of the United States,  from participating. The General Services Administration would be wise to break their contract if Trump doesn t disappear from that hotel post-haste.A professor of government procurement at the George Washington University School of Law agrees that this is a massive conflict of interest: This is a classic or textbook example of a conflict of interest. The decision-maker here, the National Park Service, works for the party that stands to benefit from a favorable decision. Trump s announcement that he s going to divest himself of his business interests entirely does little to change this, because he s still insisting that his kids will run his empire for him. Generally, placing assets in a blind trust means turning them over to someone who has no direct involvement with you, let alone the relationship of parent and child.Divesting means getting out of them completely.Trump doesn t seem to have any intention of doing either, given that his children are top members of his transition team. He does plan to hold a news conference in two weeks where he ll supposedly give details of his divestiture. That will also give them time to actually figure out how to extricate him from all his businesses.That doesn t stop the fact that he s set to get a massive tax break very soon, possibly before he s fully divested (if that s even his plan). $32 million is not pocket change to the average American taxpayer, and it doesn t look good going into the president s own pocket.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",0

Donald Trump has been steadfast in his insistence that Obamacare is failing, despite a wealth of evidence that it is not. So to make it appear as though the ACA is on its last legs, Trump has devised multiple ways to ensure that enrollment is as hard as humanly possible.The latest scheme was first reported by Kaiser Health News  Phil Galewitz:..@HHSGov did a webinar with Assisters today, disclosing its plan to shut down @HHSGov on most Sundays during open enrollment season pic.twitter.com/fOF9AlKFo8  Phil Galewitz (@philgalewitz) September 22, 2017That s right: The Department of Health and Human Services, run by Tom Price, the man currently under intense scrutiny for his unethical use of taxpayer money to charter private jets for personal travel, has announced  downtimes  for the government website, and they are insane. All websites occasionally have downtime for maintenance, of course, but HHS is actually reserving 12 hours every single Sunday during open enrollment that the website will be inaccessible.HHS had already done their best to stifle participation in Obamacare by cutting the enrollment period in half and reducing advertising and promotional funds for the ACA by ninety percent. The Department also cut funding and grants for  navigators,  or health care specialists who help enrollees find coverage that s suitable for them, to the states by forty percent.The new roadblock means that, of the limited time working people actually have to get on the website and sign up, a huge chunk of free time has just been eliminated that could have been used. Make no mistake: The Trump administration knows that Sundays are the only day many Americans have free time. And the signup process, though easy, does take some time to complete.Just like his efforts toward voter suppression, Trump is using the power of the federal government to literally harm Americans who just want to avail themselves of a service that is offered. Hopefully the legions of people who benefit from the ACA who showed up at town halls across the country this summer understand that there is still nothing wrong with the system as it is   other than that it s not single-payer   and will remember Trump and the GOP s betrayal when they head to the voting booth next time.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",0
881,"Donald Trump s Twitter feed is always a goldmine of crazy. Unfortunately, since the orange overlord is now squatting in the Oval Office, those nutty tweets tend to have the ability to derail important policy initiatives, and can therefore have disastrous effects for the nation and sometimes the world. Case in point   the fact that he insisted upon attacking Democratic leaders that he had a meeting with regarding the debt ceiling, the Children s Health Insurance Program, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), and other important domestic policy initiatives. Apparently, Trump saw fit to take to Twitter to accuse his old pals  Chuck and Nancy  of not being strong enough on crime and immigration, and therefore doesn t see a way to make deals with them:Meeting with  Chuck and Nancy  today about keeping government open and working. Problem is they want illegal immigrants flooding into our Country unchecked, are weak on Crime and want to substantially RAISE Taxes. I don t see a deal!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 28, 2017Given this out-of-the-blue attack, Democratic Minority Leaders Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Chuck Schumer (D-NY) released a joint statement promptly pulling out of the meeting, which reads: Given that the President doesn t see a deal between Democrats and the White House, we believe the best path forward is to continue negotiating with our Republican counterparts in Congress instead. Leader Pelosi then took to Twitter herself to take Trump on:Given that the President doesn t see a deal between Democrats and the White House, we believe the best path forward is to continue negotiating with our Republican counterparts in Congress instead.

1140,"Americans are opening their wallets and donating to relief efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey and with Hurricane Irma almost about to hit land in the U.S., people would be wise to be wary of which charity organization to give money to. For example, a survivor of Hurricane Harvey will be fed by the Red Cross but the food might kill them.The cauliflower doesn t even look cooked and it sits next to a few slices of what looks like ham along with crackers instead of bread.It isn t clear what the percentage of donations to the Red Cross goes to victims. The charity organization claims that 91 percent goes to victims but that s far from the truth. A Houston councilman has asked for people to not donate to the Red Cross, an organization which affords its executives with a hefty salary. I beg you not to send them a penny,  Houston City Councilman Dave Martin said at Wednesday s council meeting.  They are the most inept unorganized organization I ve ever experienced. Don t waste your money,  Martin added.  Give it to another cause. A study released by Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) claims that the Red Cross had spent $124 million   one-quarter of the money donors gave for earthquake relief in Haiti in 2010   on internal expenses.Since Hurricane Harvey hit Texas, the Red Cross has collected $211 million, according to USA Today.This Catholic charity claims that 100% of donated money goes to the victims of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.We are the official disaster relief agency of the US Catholic Church. 100% of funds go to #Harvey & #Irma relief. https://t.co/QaFD3UYALX  CatholicCharitiesUSA (@CCharitiesUSA) September 9, 2017To its credit, the Red Cross is a massive first-response organization which has sheltered and fed (see picture above) hundreds of thousands of people.A good chunk of Donald Trump s $1 million donation to victims of Hurricane Harvey went to the Red Cross..@realDonaldTrump releases list of charities he donated to for Hurricane Harvey relief. pic.twitter.com/Tb51qQJd2I  David Fahrenthold (@Fahrenthold) September 6, 2017We re not suggesting that the Red Cross feed ribeye steaks and lobster tails to hurricane victims, but geez, how about throwing together a sandwich with a few extras for the hungry survivors who are left with nothing in the world due to a natural disaster.Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images.@RedCrossHouston & @RedCross what kind of meal is this?!

2246,Saturday's presidential poll is the other 2024 election that matters.,1
545,"Maybe  thoughts and prayers  aren t the remedy following a shooting, after all. At the First United Methodist Church in East Tennessee, about 20 senior citizens gathered around for a holiday meal. After the meal, the group of elderly churchgoers decided to discuss gun safety. There has, after all, been a spate of mass shootings recently   as many as 317 so far this year. They got the idea for the conversation reportedly after a nearby county s sheriff s department held similar seminars at its local churches, according to Tellico Plains Police Chief Russ Parks. Well, I ve got my gun on me,  an 81-year-old member of the church in Tellico Plains said, according to Parks,  The Washington Post reports. The man then pulled out his holster in which he had a .38-caliber Ruger handgun. He promptly removed the magazine for everyone to see, then cleared the chamber and showed the gun to his fellow parishioners.The churchgoers discussed how to safely bring guns to church, then spoke of the deaths with recent mass shootings, like, for example, the recent Texas massacre in which a gunman shot 26 people dead as they sat in church.The 81-year-old man put the magazine back into the gun and put the gun back in the holster, Parks explained, but then later, while parishioners were cleaning up, one church member who had missed the demonstration asked the man to see the firearm   and that s when everything turned chaotic inside the church.The 81-year-old accidentally pulled the trigger without realizing the gun was loaded, then a bullet fired across the palm of the man s hand and toward his 80-year-old wife, who was sitting in a wheelchair next to him, entering her lower left abdomen, then it went out of the right side of her abdomen, into her right forearm and out the backside of her forearm. Following that, the bullet then ricocheted off the wall and landed under his wife s wheelchair, Parks said.That prompted panic in the church because some of the folks thought an active gunman was on the premises. They had their backs to it,  Parks said.  Somebody hollers,  He s been shot! She s been shot! Call 911! Due to a lot of panic during the calls to 911, the dispatcher assumed someone had entered the church and was shooting, so several schools were put on lockdown.The injured husband and wife were flown to the University of Tennessee Medical Center where they are listed critical condition.We re waiting for the NRA to say,  If only the wife had a gun, she could have protected herself.

1206,"Donald Trump just got BURNED for using Twitter so much.During an appearance on MSNBC with Lawrence O Donnell, conservative radio host Charlie Sykes was very blunt about what he thinks about Trump s intellect.O Donnell said that Trump s tweets don t mean anything but mentioned that his tweets are causing concern because a single tweet about Boeing caused its stock price to drop.Trump s use of Twitter is causing anxiety among millions of Americans, including conservatives, especially after he picked a fight with China and sucked up to Russia while declaring his intention to expand America s nuclear weapons stockpile in what he terms a  new arms race. You just don t know,  Sykes replied.  I mean, when does this jump the shark? I mean also, this is going to encapsulate, and this is really going to symbolize the quality of this man s thought. I mean, there was a time when we had presidents who read books. Now we have presidents who write in one hundred and forty character messages. You know we once had presidents who were eloquent, who could rally the nation. But, you know, here is a president who does feel comfortable on Twitter because I do think that that is the perfect venue for the quality of his thinking. And I think that that is going to be something that s going to be a defining element in his presidency. Here s the video via MSNBC:In other words, Trump is not smart enough to get his message across to the American people in more conventional ways. He would rather lazily use Twitter and the 140 character limit, which allows Trump to avoid providing details or evidence of his claims.We all know that Trump gets crushed whenever he has to debate someone in person or gets interviewed by a journalist who does their damn job.But on Twitter, Trump presents his opinions as facts and attacks anyone who criticizes him, unleashing his deplorable supporters upon the people he targets.But Twitter is not a forum for critical thinking, and Trump has demonstrated over and over again that he is not a critical thinker. He speaks before he thinks and often lashes out over the smallest slights or any other thing Fox News bitches about in the morning.Americans are sick and tired of Trump s reliance on Twitter. They want real answers and they want details, not a meaningless blurb devoid of evidence and civility.Featured Image: Mark Wilson/Getty Images",0

1027,"The GOP Congress, with the approval of Donald Trump, is putting forth yet another tax bill that would take food off the tables of regular people so the wealthy can hoard even more money. You would think they would show a modicum of shame, that they would at least pretend that they are working for the voters, but this is the age of Trump and they are proud of the oligarchy they ve created. They are so proud they are literally saying, in front of reporters, that they don t care what the voters think about this wildly unpopular tax plan.Several polls have proven that tax cuts, especially tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy, barely scratch the surface of Americans  concerns. It s hardly even a priority for brainwashed Republicans. Only about a quarter of Americans overall think tax reform should be a top priority, while barely half of Republicans (51 percent) think it should head the agenda.The majority of Americans have had it with the trickle down argument and they don t believe that a corporate tax cut will lead to more jobs.Some GOP selling points aren t sinking in. One of Republicans  biggest talking points is that a corporate tax cut will benefit workers (though even right-wing economists have cast doubt on White House estimates on this point).But nearly 60 percent of people believe corporations won t  use that money to create jobs,  according to the CBS poll. Likewise, approximately half of people in both the CBS and NBC/WSJ polls said they think the bill would grow the economy   a plurality but not a clear majority.Source: NPRScrew what voters think, at least that s the mindset of Republicans who know exactly who put them in office, the oligarchy. A Vox reporter confronted some GOP Congressmen about the tax bill that few people have seen and the most telling answer came from Rep. Chris Collins (R-NY), who in two words told us exactly what he thinks of his constituents  opinions:Others had answers the weren t quite as callous and were a bit more measured. They fell back on denial and Trump s  fake news  copout. I don t believe that poll,  stressed Texas Rep. Mike Conaway. I would love to see those polls, because those aren t polls of my constituents,  added Missouri Rep. Jason Smith.Golshan couldn t find a single Republican member of Congress who would acknowledge how unpopular the idea is with voters of passing a tax bill to let corporations pay even less of their fair share.Republicans need to work a little harder on their messaging of their pet tax bill. According to FiveThirtyEight.com, Republicans have a chance to pass their first major initiative since Trump took office, as long as they can get Americans to back it. So far, they are failing and their cavalier responses to Americans  concerns aren t helping. Of course, Collins might be right. As long as they have gerrymandering, voter suppression and Russia in their back pockets, voters  opinions might not actually matter.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images.",0

239," Antifa (Photo: Twitter)Diana Johnstone 21st Century Wire Fascists are divided into two categories, the fascists and the anti-fascists  ~ Ennio FlaianoIn recent weeks, a totally disoriented left has been widely exhorted to unify around a masked vanguard calling itself Antifa, for anti-fascist. Hooded and dressed in black, Antifa is essentially a variation of the Black Bloc, familiar for introducing violence into peaceful demonstrations in many countries. Imported from Europe, the label Antifa sounds more political. It also serves the purpose of stigmatizing those it attacks as  fascists .Despite its imported European name, Antifa is basically just another example of America s steady descent into violence.Historical PretensionsAntifa first came to prominence from its role in reversing Berkeley s proud  free speech  tradition by preventing right wing personalities from speaking there. But its moment of glory was its clash with rightwingers in Charlottesville on August 12, largely because Trump commented that there were  good people on both sides . With exuberant Schadenfreude, commentators grabbed the opportunity to condemn the despised President for his  moral equivalence , thereby bestowing a moral blessing on Antifa.Charlottesville served as a successful book launching for Antifa: the Antifascist Handbook, whose author, young academic Mark Bray, is an Antifa in both theory and practice. The book is  really taking off very fast , rejoiced the publisher, Melville House. It instantly won acclaim from leading mainstream media such as the New York Times,The Guardian and NBC, not hitherto known for rushing to review leftwing books, least of all those by revolutionary anarchists.The Washington Post welcomed Bray as spokesman for  insurgent activist movements  and observed that: The book s most enlightening contribution is on the history of anti-fascist efforts over the past century, but its most relevant for today is its justification for stifling speech and clobbering white supremacists. Bray s  enlightening contribution  is to a tell a flattering version of the Antifa story to a generation whose dualistic, Holocaust-centered view of history has largely deprived them of both the factual and the analytical tools to judge multidimensional events such as the growth of fascism. Bray presents today s Antifa as though it were the glorious legitimate heir to every noble cause since abolitionism. But there were no anti-fascists before fascism, and the label  Antifa  by no means applies to all the many adversaries of fascism.The implicit claim to carry on the tradition of the International Brigades who fought in Spain against Franco is nothing other than a form of innocence by association. Since we must revere the heroes of the Spanish Civil War, some of that esteem is supposed to rub off on their self-designated heirs. Unfortunately, there are no veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade still alive to point to the difference between a vast organized defense against invading fascist armies and skirmishes on the Berkeley campus. As for the Anarchists of Catalonia, the patent on anarchism ran out a long time ago, and anyone is free to market his own generic.The original Antifascist movement was an effort by the Communist International to cease hostilities with Europe s Socialist Parties in order to build a common front against the triumphant movements led by Mussolini and Hitler.Since Fascism thrived, and Antifa was never a serious adversary, its apologists thrive on the  nipped in the bud  claim:  if only  Antifascists had beat up the fascist movements early enough, the latter would have been nipped in the bud. Since reason and debate failed to stop the rise of fascism, they argue, we must use street violence   which, by the way, failed even more decisively.This is totally ahistorical. Fascism exalted violence, and violence was its preferred testing ground. Both Communists and Fascists were fighting in the streets and the atmosphere of violence helped fascism thrive as a bulwark against Bolshevism, gaining the crucial support of leading capitalists and militarists in their countries, which brought them to power.Since historic fascism no longer exists, Bray s Antifa have broadened their notion of  fascism  to include anything that violates the current Identity Politics canon: from  patriarchy  (a pre-fascist attitude to put it mildly) to  transphobia  (decidedly a post-fascist problem).The masked militants of Antifa seem to be more inspired by Batman than by Marx or even by Bakunin.Storm Troopers of the Neoliberal War PartySince Mark Bray offers European credentials for current US Antifa, it is appropriate to observe what Antifa amounts to in Europe today.In Europe, the tendency takes two forms. Black Bloc activists regularly invade various leftist demonstrations in order to smash windows and fight the police. These testosterone exhibits are of minor political significance, other than provoking public calls to strengthen police forces. They are widely suspected of being influenced by police infiltration.As an example, last September 23, several dozen black-clad masked ruffians, tearing down posters and throwing stones, attempted to storm the platform where the flamboyant Jean-Luc M lenchon was to address the mass meeting of La France Insoumise, today the leading leftist party in France. Their unspoken message seemed to be that nobody is revolutionary enough for them. Occasionally, they do actually spot a random skinhead to beat up. This establishes their credentials as  anti-fascist .They use these credentials to arrogate to themselves the right to slander others in a sort of informal self-appointed inquisition.As prime example, in late 2010, a young woman named Ornella Guyet appeared in Paris seeking work as a journalist in various leftist periodicals and blogs. She  tried to infiltrate everywhere , according to the former director of Le Monde diplomatique, Maurice Lemoine, who  always intuitively distrusted her  when he hired her as an intern.Viktor Dedaj, who manages one of the main leftist sites in France, Le Grand Soir, was among those who tried to help her, only to experience an unpleasant surprise a few months later. Ornella had become a self-appointed inquisitor dedicated to denouncing  conspirationism, confusionism, anti-Semitism and red-brown  on Internet. This took the form of personal attacks on individuals whom she judged to be guilty of those sins. What is significant is that all her targets were opposed to US and NATO aggressive wars in the Middle East.Indeed, the timing of her crusade coincided with the  regime change  wars that destroyed Libya and tore apart Syria. The attacks singled out leading critics of those wars.Viktor Dedaj was on her hit list. So was Michel Collon, close to the Belgian Workers Party, author, activist and manager of the bilingual site Investig action. So was Fran ois Ruffin, film-maker, editor of the leftist journal Fakir elected recently to the National Assembly on the list of M lenchon s party La France Insoumise. And so on. The list is long.The targeted personalities are diverse, but all have one thing in common: opposition to aggressive wars. What s more, so far as I can tell, just about everyone opposed to those wars is on her list.The main technique is guilt by association. High on the list of mortal sins is criticism of the European Union, which is associated with  nationalism  which is associated with  fascism  which is associated with  anti-Semitism , hinting at a penchant for genocide. This coincides perfectly with the official policy of the EU and EU governments, but Antifa uses much harsher language.In mid-June 2011, the anti-EU party Union Populaire R publicaine led by Fran ois Asselineau was the object of slanderous insinuations on Antifa internet sites signed by  Marie-Anne Boutoleau  (a pseudonym for Ornella Guyet). Fearing violence, owners cancelled scheduled UPR meeting places in Lyon. UPR did a little investigation, discovering that Ornella Guyet was on the speakers list at a March 2009 Seminar on International Media organized in Paris by the Center for the Study of International Communications and the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. A surprising association for such a zealous crusader against  red-brown .In case anyone has doubts,  red-brown  is a term used to smear anyone with generally leftist views   that is,  red    with the fascist color  brown . This smear can be based on having the same opinion as someone on the right, speaking on the same platform with someone on the right, being published alongside someone on the right, being seen at an anti-war demonstration also attended by someone on the right, and so on. This is particularly useful for the War Party, since these days, many conservatives are more opposed to war than leftists who have bought into the  humanitarian war  mantra.The government doesn t need to repress anti-war gatherings. Antifa does the job.The Franco-African comedien Dieudonn  M Bala M Bala, stigmatized for anti-Semitism since 2002 for his tv sketch lampooning an Israeli settler as part of George W. Bush s  Axis of Good , is not only a target, but serves as a guilty association for anyone who defends his right to free speech   such as Belgian professor Jean Bricmont, virtually blacklisted in France for trying to get in a word in favor of free speech during a TV talk show. Dieudonn  has been banned from the media, sued and fined countless times, even sentenced to jail in Belgium, but continues to enjoy a full house of enthusiastic supporters at his one-man shows, where the main political message is opposition to war.Still, accusations of being soft on Dieudonn  can have serious effects on individuals in more precarious positions, since the mere hint of  anti-Semitism  can be a career killer in France. Invitations are cancelled, publications refused, messages go unanswered.In April 2016, Ornella Guyet dropped out of sight, amid strong suspicions about her own peculiar associations.The moral of this story is simple. Self-appointed radical revolutionaries can be the most useful thought police for the neoliberal war party.I am not suggesting that all, or most, Antifa are agents of the establishment. But they can be manipulated, infiltrated or impersonated precisely because they are self-anointed and usually more or less disguised.Silencing Necessary DebateOne who is certainly sincere is Mark Bray, author of The Intifa Handbook. It is clear where Mark Bray is coming from when he writes (p.36-7):  Hitler s  final solution  murdered six million Jews in gas chambers, with firing squads, through hunger an lack of medical treatment in squalid camps and ghettoes, with beatings, by working them to death, and through suicidal despair. Approximately two out of every three Jews on the continent were killed, including some of my relatives. This personal history explains why Mark Bray feels passionately about  fascism . This is perfectly understandable in one who is haunted by fear that  it can happen again .However, even the most justifiable emotional concerns do not necessarily contribute to wise counsel. Violent reactions to fear may seem to be strong and effective when in reality they are morally weak and practically ineffectual.We are in a period of great political confusion. Labeling every manifestation of  political incorrectness  as fascism impedes clarification of debate over issues that very much need to be defined and clarified.The scarcity of fascists has been compensated by identifying criticism of immigration as fascism. This identification, in connection with rejection of national borders, derives much of its emotional force above all from the ancestral fear in the Jewish community of being excluded from the nations in which they find themselves.The issue of immigration has different aspects in different places. It is not the same in European countries as in the United States. There is a basic distinction between immigrants and immigration. Immigrants are people who deserve consideration. Immigration is a policy that needs to be evaluated. It should be possible to discuss the policy without being accused of persecuting the people. After all, trade union leaders have traditionally opposed mass immigration, not out of racism, but because it can be a deliberate capitalist strategy to bring down wages.In reality, immigration is a complex subject, with many aspects that can lead to reasonable compromise. But to polarize the issue misses the chances for compromise. By making mass immigration the litmus test of whether or not one is fascist, Antifa intimidation impedes reasonable discussion. Without discussion, without readiness to listen to all viewpoints, the issue will simply divide the population into two camps, for and against. And who will win such a confrontation?A recent survey* shows that mass immigration is increasingly unpopular in all European countries. The complexity of the issue is shown by the fact that in the vast majority of European countries, most people believe they have a duty to welcome refugees, but disapprove of continued mass immigration. The official argument that immigration is a good thing is accepted by only 40%, compared to 60% of all Europeans who believe that  immigration is bad for our country . A left whose principal cause is open borders will become increasingly unpopular.Childish ViolenceThe idea that the way to shut someone up is to punch him in the jaw is as American as Hollywood movies. It is also typical of the gang war that prevails in certain parts of Los Angeles. Banding together with others  like us  to fight against gangs of  them  for control of turf is characteristic of young men in uncertain circumstances. The search for a cause can involve endowing such conduct with a political purpose: either fascist or antifascist. For disoriented youth, this is an alternative to joining the US Marines.American Antifa looks very much like a middle class wedding between Identity Politics and gang warfare. Mark Bray (page 175) quotes his DC Antifa source as implying that the motive of would-be fascists is to side with  the most powerful kid in the block  and will retreat if scared. Our gang is tougher than your gang.That is also the logic of US imperialism, which habitually declares of its chosen enemies:  All they understand is force.  Although Antifa claim to be radical revolutionaries, their mindset is perfectly typical the atmosphere of violence which prevails in militarized America.In another vein, Antifa follows the trend of current Identity Politics excesses that are squelching free speech in what should be its citadel, academia. Words are considered so dangerous that  safe spaces  must be established to protect people from them. This extreme vulnerability to injury from words is strangely linked to tolerance of real physical violence.Wild Goose ChaseIn the United States, the worst thing about Antifa is the effort to lead the disoriented American left into a wild goose chase, tracking down imaginary  fascists  instead of getting together openly to work out a coherent positive program. The United States has more than its share of weird individuals, of gratuitous aggression, of crazy ideas, and tracking down these marginal characters, whether alone or in groups, is a huge distraction. The truly dangerous people in the United States are safely ensconced in Wall Street, in Washington Think Tanks, in the executive suites of the sprawling military industry, not to mention the editorial offices of some of the mainstream media currently adopting a benevolent attitude toward  anti-fascists  simply because they are useful in focusing on the maverick Trump instead of themselves.Antifa USA, by defining  resistance to fascism  as resistance to lost causes   the Confederacy, white supremacists and for that matter Donald Trump   is actually distracting from resistance to the ruling neoliberal establishment, which is also opposed to the Confederacy and white supremacists and has already largely managed to capture Trump by its implacable campaign of denigration. That ruling establishment, which in its insatiable foreign wars and introduction of police state methods, has successfully used popular  resistance to Trump  to make him even worse than he already was.The facile use of the term  fascist  gets in the way of thoughtful identification and definition of the real enemy of humanity today. In the contemporary chaos, the greatest and most dangerous upheavals in the world all stem from the same source, which is hard to name, but which we might give the provisional simplified label of Globalized Imperialism. This amounts to a multifaceted project to reshape the world to satisfy the demands of financial capitalism, the military industrial complex, United States ideological vanity and the megalomania of leaders of lesser  Western  powers, notably Israel. It could be called simply  imperialism , except that it is much vaster and more destructive than the historic imperialism of previous centuries. It is also much more disguised. And since it bears no clear label such as  fascism , it is difficult to denounce in simple terms.The fixation on preventing a form of tyranny that arose over 80 years ago, under very different circumstances, obstructs recognition of the monstrous tyranny of today. Fighting the previous war leads to defeat.Donald Trump is an outsider who will not be let inside. The election of Donald Trump is above all a grave symptom of the decadence of the American political system, totally ruled by money, lobbies, the military-industrial complex and corporate media. Their lies are undermining the very basis of democracy. Antifa has gone on the offensive against the one weapon still in the hands of the people: the right to free speech and assembly.***Diana Johnstone is author of the introduction to her father s memoir, From MAD to Madness: Inside Pentagon Nuclear War Planning, by Paul H.

Ron Paul (@RonPaul) August 22, 2017One could only wish that the 82-year-old Paul, a man who has run for president three times as both a Libertarian and Republican, and one who also holds a degree in Medicine from Duke University, would be slightly more intelligent, but apparently that just isn t the case. We currently have a President in office who is concerned the with mainstream media spouting  fake news,  yet doesn t call out fellow or former Republicans when they do the exact same thing, however, fortunately there were plenty of people on Twitter who were willing to do so on Trump s behalf.Actually he's right.

Wulander (@WuShocks) August 22, 2017Even if we were to give Paul the benefit of the doubt and believe he made a simple absent-minded error, his factually-deficient tweet proves that it is people like him who are the main source of this  fake news  problem. All it would ve taken was a little fact-checking and proof-reading to see the error in his propaganda, but maybe we can clear it up for him if he is able to see the flaw in his tweet, wants to retract the statement, but can t be bothered with the research.Al-Qaeda was founded by Osama Bin Laden, Abdullah Azzah, and other Arab volunteers in the 1980s to fight the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, however, they will forever go down in history for the 9/11 terror attacks, an event that definitely happened before the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. ISIS, on the other hand, achieved notoriety following the U.S. invasion of Iraq, but they still existed before then, founded in 1999 by Jordanian Salafi jihadist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi under the name Jam at al-Taw d wa-al-Jih d and pledging their allegiance to Al-Qaeda in 2004.See, Ron, fact-checking isn t that difficult and it helps prevent opening old wounds, or ones that are still reasonably fresh with the pain still being felt to this day, wounds such as 9/11.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",0
1078,"We all remember the absolutely disastrous visit Donald Trump had with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. He infamously made her look at him like he had lost his mind when joked about her allegedly being wiretapped by the Obama Administration while he was busy trying to defend his own false claims that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower, refused to shake Merkel s hand during a photo op, and even tried to give her a bill for NATO worth billions of dollars.Trump, however, seems to have a very different memory of his visit with the German leader. While speaking of the visit with the Associated Press, Trump said: Yeah, it s funny: One of the best chemistries I had was with Merkel. As if that weren t ridiculous enough, considering that the whole world saw how that visit actually went, Trump continued, this time trying to excuse his rudeness with the handshake debacle: And I guess somebody shouted out,  Shake her hand, shake her hand,  you know. But I never heard it. But I had already shaken her hand four times. You know, because we were together for a long time. He went on to boast: Because, um, I m at odds on, you know, the NATO payments and I m at odds on immigration. Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",0

578,"Anthony Scaramucci got his ass handed to him on Sunday morning by CNN host Jake Tapper.Just a day has gone by since Scaramucci became the White House communications director, resulting in the resignation of Sean Spicer as press secretary a mere six months into Trump s presidency, and he is already insisting that the Russians did not interfere with the 2016 Election just because Trump said so.That s despite our nation s intelligence agencies and former and current intelligence officials confirming otherwise.During a discussion about whether Trump will sign the bipartisan legislation that slaps sanctions on Russia, Scaramucci used an anonymous source to claim that the American people have been misinformed about Russia. There s a lot of disinformation,  Scaramucci said.  Somebody said to me the other day   I don t want to say who   if the Russians actually hacked this situation and spilled out those emails, you would have never seen it. You would have never had any evidence of them. Meaning that they re super confident in their deception skills and hacking. But our intelligence agencies have confirmed that Russian did, in fact, meddle in our election by attacking our democratic institutions by hacking, which can be traced back to the perpetrators by our own professional cyber security experts. Basically, Scaramucci is claiming that the Russians are too good to get caught by us. That s simply not true.And Tapper was quick to call Scaramucci out for it, but not before he slammed Scaramucci for citing an anonymous source. Wait, wait, wait,  Tapper chimed in.  I don t know who this anonymous person is. And then Scaramucci demonstrated that, just like Trump, he can t keep his mouth shut and is a leaker. How about it s the president, Jake,  Scaramucci replied.  He called me from Air Force One and basically said to me,  This is   maybe they did it, maybe they didn t do it. Wow. That s truly pathetic.Tapper proceeded to tear Scaramucci apart for being Trump s yes-man instead of accepting the analysis of our own intelligence agencies and Trump s own Director of National Intelligence. This is exactly the issue!  Tapper said.  We have experts, the U.S. intelligence agencies [are] unanimous, both Obama appointees and Trump appointees   the director of national intelligence, the head of the National Security Agency, the head of the FBI. I mean, all of these intelligence experts, saying, Russia hacked the election, they tried to interfere in the election. President Trump is contradicting it and you re siding with President Trump! Indeed, it certainly appears Scaramucci is just shilling for Trump and he even proceeded to whine about Tapper s observation, leading Tapper to ask,  Don t you owe a duty to the truth? Scaramucci then claimed that he doesn t know what the truth is because:  I don t have the information in front of me. But he didn t even bother to get the information. Instead, he got talking points from Trump and merely parroted them on television like a good little lapdog.Here s the video via YouTube.Scaramucci is already making it clear that he is untrustworthy. He just threw our intelligence community under the bus and demonstrated that he is the kind of leaker that Trump whines about. He couldn t even stop himself from bragging about how Trump himself was the anonymous source who told him Russia didn t hack us. The evidence clearly shows that Russia attacked us and our democratic institutions. Only self-serving fools would believe otherwise. Featured Image: Screenshot",0
1216,"21st Century Wire says F. William Engdahl is a strategic risk consultant and lecturer, he holds a degree in politics from Princeton University and is a best-selling author on oil and geopolitics. Engdahl was a guest alongside Adam Garrie of The Duran on a power packed edition of The Sunday Wire with Patrick Henningsen entitled  War And Peace . If you didn t get the chance to catch it, you can find that podcast here.More on this report from GlobalResearch  (Image   TIME)F. William Engdahl GlobalResearch The campaign promises were grandiose just like the candidate. Donald Trump wooed millions of American voters with his pledge to  make America great again.  He promised a $1 trillion infrastructure plan to revitalize the de facto depressed national economy. He promised to bring jobs back from China, Mexico and elsewhere by renegotiating major trade deals or scotching them entirely as with the Trans-Pacific Partnership of the Obama era, a scheme which Trump rightly said would take even more American jobs. After 100 days in office what are the prospects that his economic program will bring positive changes to Americans?Dismal to put it mildly. Of course that should come as no shock to anyone taking a closer look at who is Trump, or more correctly his transition team brought in to run White House economic policy.That Dubious Wall Street Economics TeamThe top economic and financial position in the Trump Cabinet is held by of Steve Mnuchin, Secretary of the Treasury, a veteran Wall Street banker for 17 years at Goldman Sachs. As an undergraduate at Yale University, for those interested in occult matters, Mnuchin was inducted into the bizarre Skull & Bones secret society in 1985, the same secret society where George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush were initiates.After leaving Goldman Sachs, Mnuchin was several times a business partner with notorious convicted hedge fund insider trader, George Soros, the putative  Daddy  Warbucks today of CIA and USAID regime change NGOs around the world. Both Mnuchin and Soros, with other investors, made a literal killing on the ravages of the US sub-prime real estate collapse. They bought bankrupt California mortgage lender IndyMac from the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation during the 2008 sub-prime mortgage crisis at a bargain price. Mnuchin was severely criticized as owner and CEO of IndyMac for making money by foreclosing aggressively on homes at a rate double the norms of the banking industry. He was sued over questionable foreclosures, and settled several cases for millions of dollars. He violated the Fair Housing Act by not lending money to African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians. If we are to believe him, he told the financial TV CNBC last November it would be the Trump administration s job to  make sure that the average American has wage increases and good jobs. A second key member of Donald Trump s economic team is Wilbur Ross, Secretary of Commerce. Ross, a billionaire, was for 24 years head of N.M. Rothschild & Sons New York office for bankruptcy-restructuring, a euphemism for what is called  asset-stripping,  where he earned the title,  King of Bankruptcy.  Ross  ties to Trump go back to the 1980 s when Ross helped Trump avoid foreclosure on The Donald s three Atlantic City gambling casinos. Ross  International Coal Group owned a West Virginia coal mine where an explosion in 2006 killed 12 miners. It was later revealed by his former associates that Ross knew well that the mine was sub-standard in safety but did nothing to correct it. In 2014 Ross was named head or  Grand Swipe  of a secret Wall Street fraternity, Kappa Beta Phi, founded in 1929 just before the stock market crash, whose stated purpose is to  keep alive the spirit of the  good old days of 1928 29.  Michael Bloomberg, former Goldman Sachs CEO Jon Corzine, Laurence Fink CEO of the $4.5 trillion financial firm BlackRock, are some of the very select members of Ross  Wall Street fraternity.The Trump Director of the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), responsible for drafting the President s annual Budget, is former US Congressman Mike Mulvaney. In his first Trump Budget proposal Mulvaney cut funds for a program  Meals on Wheels  which brings food to disabled, claiming the program showed no  results.  The program delivers meals to individual homes and senior citizen centers, feeding more than 2.4 million Americans 60 and older, more than half a million of them veterans according to their website. The government says that most recipients live alone, take more than six medications, and rely on these meals for at least half the food they consume.Gary Cohn is the White House Director of the National Economic Council. He came to the job directly from Goldman Sachs where he was President and Chief Operating Officer. Cohn led a Goldman Sachs delegation to Greece in 2009 to try to convince the Greek government to use derivatives to push debt due dates into the distant future. Goldman Sachs in fact, while Cohn held a top position in 2001, devised the exotic derivatives scheme to hide billions in state debt from Brussels that enabled Greece to illegally qualify to join the Eurozone.This is the gang that we are supposed to believe will  make America great again,  and to  make sure that the average American has wage increases and good jobs.  In fact, based on what they have released to date, they will destroy much of what little remains of a functioning national economy and a stable middle-class.

Just yesterday, protesters surprised Trump by showing up on his route to his golf course despite the fact that he had tried to keep the trip a secret. How d they know? Unfortunately for Trump, protesters correctly guessed that just 48 hours after he kickstarted a war in Syria he would probably be back on his golf course.Pool: Motorcade passed ""group of about a dozen protesters w/ signs reading ""Resign,"" ""Loser,"" and ""Impeach Trump"" outside the golf course.""  Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) April 8, 2017Trump clearly doesn t enjoy seeing reminders that his presidency is highly unpopular. This appears to be Trump s solution:The newest addition to Mar a Lago  a helipad and Trump chopper. pic.twitter.com/Hxb8QyR8Uu  Vivian Salama (@vmsalama) April 9, 2017Trump s administration claims the helipad was built to carry Trump from the airport to his resort without interrupting traffic. They also conceded that traffic will likely still be blocked off or otherwise disrupted near the resort each time he is in town   roughly once a week. And like everything Trump does, the helipad comes at the expense of the average people unlucky enough to live nearby Trump s resort.When the proposal was first drawn up, it faced criticism for its disruptions to the lives of those around the area:Jesse H. Diner, a Fort Lauderdale attorney representing Woodbridge Avenue resident Nancy deMoss, urged commissioners to hold off on approving the project until they consider alternatives to the location. These are big helicopters, they re like flying tanks,  Diner said.DeMoss requires around-the-clock health care that has been impacted by Trump s weekend visits. Diner said she and her family is worried that the loud helicopters will be a nuisance, and she is uncomfortable with the U.S. Coast Guard boats sporting guns when Trump is in town.Trump went ahead with the plan anyway.Adding more absurdity, Trump s personal helicopter appears to be using the helipad this weekend. The official Marine One, nor Trump, have used the helipad so far, but a giant helicopter with Trump s name printed in red across the tail sat in its spot. Trump s staff said it would be  staged  there until Sunday   a shameless photo op attempt.It s also not clear whether Trump or taxpayers are paying for the helipad used exclusively to indulge Trump s golf obsession. The helipad was registered by the National Trust for Historic Preservation suggesting Trump wants to treat his helipad as a site of national significance as if it s Mount Rushmore and not an excuse for Trump to take more vacations.If the cost of the helipad indeed comes out of the pockets of taxpayers it will be a stiff addition to the already $23 million Trump has spent taking vacations while president for just 11 weeks. At this rate, Trump is projected to eclipse Obama s entire cost of travel in just 10 months.It s for this reason that Trump appears desperate to rebrand his opulent resort as the  Southern White House  in order to deflect criticisms that he s too often partying there instead of doing the job of president. It would be unsurprising to find that someday Trump renames the 18th hole at his Florida golf course after the Oval Office.Featured image via Twitter",0
251,"When asked if a pre-emptive military strike is a possibility, as reported last week by NBC News, Trump wouldn t elaborate. I don t want to telegraph what I m doing or what I m thinking. I m not like other administrations, where they say we re going to do this in four weeks,  Trump told Fox s Ainsley Earhardt It doesn t work that way. We ll see what happens. I hope things work out well. I hope there s going to be peace, but they ve been talking with this gentleman for a long time,  he continued. You read Clinton s book. and he said,  Oh, we made such a great peace deal,  and it was a joke,  Trump said.  You look at different things over the years with President Obama. Everybody has been outplayed.  The HillNorth Korea doesn t appear to be backing off as they continue to push forward with the testing of their intercontinental ballistic missiles. They called the launching of their second flight test yesterday, a  stern warning  to the United States. David Wright, a physicist and co-director of the global security program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said that if reports of the missile s maximum altitude and flight time are correct, it would have a theoretical range of at least 10,400 kilometers (about 6,500 miles). That means it could have reached Los Angeles, Denver or Chicago, depending on variables such as the size and weight of the warhead that would be carried atop such a missile in an actual attack.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said Saturday the second flight test of an intercontinental ballistic missile demonstrated his country can hit the U.S. mainland, hours after the launch left analysts concluding that a wide swath of the United States, including Los Angeles and Chicago, is now in range of North Korean weapons.The Korean Central News Agency said that Kim expressed  great satisfaction  after the Hwasong-14 missile reached a maximum height of 3,725 kilometers (2,314 miles) and traveled 998 kilometers (620 miles) before accurately landing in waters off Japan. The agency said that the test was aimed at confirming the maximum range and other technical aspects of the missile it says was capable of delivering a  large-sized, heavy nuclear warhead. Analysts had estimated that the North s first ICBM on July 4 could have reached Alaska, and said that the latest missile appeared to extend that range significantly.Immediately after the launch, U.S. and South Korean forces conducted live-fire exercises. South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo called for the deployment of strategic U.S. military assets   which usually means stealth bombers and aircraft carriers   as well as additional launchers of an advanced U.S. anti-missile system.Japanese government spokesman Yoshihide Suga said the missile, launched late Friday night, flew for about 45 minutes   about five minutes longer than the first. The missile was launched on very high trajectory, which limited the distance it traveled, and landed west of Japan s island of Hokkaido.The KCNA quoted Kim as saying that the launch reaffirmed the reliability of the country s ICBM system and an ability to fire at  random regions and locations at random times  with the  entire  U.S. mainland now within range. The agency said that the test confirmed important features of the missile system, such as the proper separation of the warhead and controlling its movement and detonation after atmospheric re-entry.Kim said the launch sent a  serious warning  to the United States, which has been  meaninglessly blowing its trumpet  with threats of war and stronger sanctions, the KCNA said.President Donald Trump issued a statement condemning the missile test as a threat to the world, and rejecting North Korea s claim that nuclear weapons ensure its security.  In reality, they have the opposite effect,  he said.Trump said the weapons and tests  further isolate North Korea, weaken its economy, and deprive its people.  He vowed to  take all necessary steps  to ensure the security of the U.S. and its allies.ABC News   On July 4th, 2917, A U.S. official confirmed that North Korea launched a two-stage intercontinental ballistic missile. It was the first successfully test-fired ICBM for North Korea, which has been attempting to build a missile that can reach the U.S. mainland.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in March that  all options are on the table  to deal with the escalating threat North Korea poses.The Department of Defense has an extensive missile defense system designed to help protect against a missile attack from that country.In May the U.S. conducted the ground-based intercept system s first test against an ICBM-class target. The interceptor was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, and the ICBM target was launched from Kwajalein Atoll, part of the Marshall Islands in the Pacific. The result: The ICBM was intercepted, which was likened to firing a bullet and hitting another bullet. This system is vitally important to the defense of our homeland, and this test demonstrates that we have a capable, credible deterrent against a very real threat,  said Vice Adm. Jim Syring, the director of the Missile Defense Agency at the time.There are 36 ground-based interceptors at two military bases in the U.S.   32 at Fort Greely in Alaska and four at Vandenberg.Watch:Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida said he told U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in a phone call that the second missile test greatly increased the threat from Pyongyang. He said two sides agreed to consider all means necessary to exert the utmost pressure on North Korea. They reiterated calls for new sanctions and to work closely together with South Korea along with efforts by China and Russia.China, meanwhile, urged its ally North Korea to abide by U.N. Security Council resolutions and halt any moves that could escalate tensions on the Korean Peninsula.Washington and its allies have watched with growing concern as Pyongyang has made significant progress toward its goal of having all of the U.S. within range of its missiles to counter what it labels as U.S. aggression. There are other hurdles, including building nuclear warheads to fit on those missiles and ensuring reliability. But many analysts have been surprised by how quickly leader Kim Jong Un has developed North Korea s nuclear and missile programs despite several rounds of U.N. Security Council sanctions that have squeezed the impoverished country s economy.Trump has said he will not allow North Korea to obtain an ICBM that can deliver a nuclear warhead. But this week, the Defense Intelligence Agency reportedly concluded that the North will have a reliable ICBM capable of carrying a nuclear weapon as early as next year, in an assessment that trimmed two years from the agency s earlier estimate.

1200,"Your tax dollars up in smoke thanks to the USDA. The two culprits are food stamps and the school lunch program. We cannot afford to feed the entire world or the millions of illegals crossing our border. The U.S. spent a record $80.4 billion on giving free groceries to Americans but also to non-citizens. The bloated federal agency charged with feeding the poor and eradiating  food insecurity  in the U.S. blew nearly $7 billion to provide  ineligible recipients  with the welfare benefit and there appears to be no end in sight to the fleecing.In fact, the agency, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), has for years violated a measure known as the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act (IPERA) that requires agencies to conduct annual risk assessments to identify programs that make  significant improper payments  of $10 million or more. Not only has the USDA violated IPERA in the last four years, it also refuses to implement a more efficient verification process before doling out benefits by asserting that it would  create barriers for families that need help. Last year the USDA made an astounding $6.9 billion of  improper payments,  according to a scathing report made public this week by the agency s inspector general. Two programs accounted for a chunk of the money that was wasted; food stamps, officially known as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to eliminate the stigma of welfare and the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) which cost American taxpayers a whopping $16 billion in 2014. Of the $6.9 billion in fraudulent payments made by the USDA, those two programs accounted for $4.2 billion. Thus, they have been coined  high-risk programs,  according to the USDA watchdog.The overwhelming majority of improper payments go to provide ineligible recipients with goods or services, the report confirms. This is par for the course at the USDA and the agency seems to have no intention of cleaning up its rolls. In fact, the agency goes out of its way to cover up wrongdoing in four of its most fraud-infested programs.  USDA is noncompliant with the improper payment requirements for a fourth consecutive year,  the report says. Not coincidentally, a separate probe conducted by the investigative arm of Congress, also found that the USDA needs to improve its verification process for program access. That report, also made public this week, focuses only on the National School Lunch Program, which is notorious for wasting millions of taxpayer dollars.Also this week, Congress held a special hearing to address waste, fraud and abuse in child nutrition programs operated by the USDA. At the hearing, held by the House Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education, witnesses identified misused taxpayer dollars in three of the nation s largest child nutrition programs, which include school lunch and breakfast. The Forensic Audits and Investigative Service director at the Government Accountability Office (GAO) testified that both programs have been designated as  high-error  by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). In fact, nearly half of the households that received benefits were not eligible because their income exceeded eligibility guidelines, according to the director Jessica Lucas-Judy.Judicial Watch has reported extensively on the pervasive fraud and corruption in the government s various food assistance programs, especially food stamps, which has grown immensely under President Obama. Last year JW reported that the government spent a mind-boggling $80.4 billion to give a record number of people many who didn t even qualify for the welfare benefit free groceries. A few years ago JW uncovered documents that show illegal immigrants also receive food stamps from Uncle Sam under an outrageous initiative with the Mexican government to promote participation by undocumented aliens.Via: Judicial Watch",0

481,"OKLAHOMA CITY   The Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled the cigarette tax passed late in the legislative session unconstitutional Thursday morning.The tax was expected to bring in more than $200 million of revenue for the state budget by tacking on an extra $1.50 per pack of cigarettes. The budget was planned and passed assuming the tax would hold.The tax was originally passed after the deadline for revenue raising bills, but Republican lawmakers tried to eke it through as a fee. A tax would have required a three-fourths majority to pass. Justices on Thursday ruled that, because the funds raised could be used for non-smoking related programs, the bill could not go through as a regulatory fee.The State now has a week to seek a rehearing. If it does not, the ruling is final.Gov. Mary Fallin issued a response to the Supreme Court s ruling:I am disappointed to hear the Supreme Court struck down the smoking cessation fee, but I certainly respect the justices  authority. I will be discussing with legislative leaders from both parties the need to address the $215 million shortfall this will create for the Department of Human Services, the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services and the Oklahoma Health Care Authority, the three agencies that received the bulk of the money that was to be generated by the cessation fee.These agencies and the people they serve cannot sustain the kind of cuts that will occur if we do not find a solution. My belief is we will have to come into special session to address this issue.House Minority Leader Scott Inman released the following statement on the ruling:Once again, Governor Fallin and Republican legislators have failed Oklahoma. My caucus and I sounded every alarm bell we could to stop this from happening, yet here we are, just as we warned.Today, I m urging Governor Fallin to call for a special session and for Republican leaders to come together with myself and Sen. Sparks and draft a truly bipartisan and constitutional budget plan that will help to restore, reinvest in, and rebuild Oklahoma.With our state agencies facing more budget cuts and with even more rulings waiting, the time is now to work out a budget agreement before a special session of the legislature. By coming together now and putting a plan in place, we can save precious time and taxpayer dollars to fix the mess that their failed leadership has put us in because of their failed policies to cut taxes for the wealthy and well-connected.This cigarette tax was just a Band-Aid put on their gaping wound of a budget hole. Schools are down to 4-day weeks, hospitals are closing down, and public safety is in a crisis, not because cigarettes are too cheap, but because Republican policies benefitting their donors have failed us.For entire story: News 9",0

277,"While President Trump s approval rating continues to fall to embarrassing ans unprecedented levels, new polling has come out that shows dismal numbers of support towards his hateful, unconstitutional executive orders.According to Gallup Polling, the majority of the American public has an unfavorable view towards Trump s most controversial orders, including the ban on immigration refuge from seven majority-Muslim countries.Here s what the poll found:The poll also found that President Trump s approval rating 43% while his disapproval rating stands at 52 percent, a net negative 9 points. Only 41 percent of independent voters approve of Trump s performance as president, along with 83 percent of Republicans.Almost half of America believes Trump is acting  too fast  in his first days in office.Simply put: Trump is (still) hated by the American public and so are his most controversial executive actions. The only people that seem to like him are the Republicans that voted him in. Still, over one-sixth of the GOP doesn t seem to like him at this point.As Gallup s analysis concludes:Trump is not enjoying the type of honeymoon that the American public accorded his predecessors in their first weeks in office. Trump s initial job approval rating was the lowest in Gallup history, and a majority of Americans continue to disapprove of the job he is doing. No other president going back to Dwight Eisenhower had majority disapproval in his first several months in office. A majority of Americans, in similar fashion, disapprove of several of the high-visibility executive actions Trump has taken within his first 10 days in the White House.This polarization of opinion most likely reflects not only Trump himself   his style and the actions he has taken   but also the prevailing political environment today.The only thing Trump cares about is how people feel about him. His numbers aren t getting better, and they have   for the better part of two years   been embarrassingly low (in the mid forties).Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",0

234,"Ivanka Trump just proved that she doesn t support pay equality, and the Internet damned her to hell for her hypocrisy.During his presidency, President Obama issued a set of rules designed to help end pay discrimination on the basis of gender and race.The rules would have required employers to give pay data to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Such data would have been used as evidence of pay discrimination which could then be used to shape policies to end such practices.But Donald Trump killed those rules this week and excused his action by claiming that they violate the Paperwork Reduction Act. In short, Trump used a bullshit excuse to hurt women and minorities, and gave employers the power to discriminate at will.One would think that Ivanka Trump would be pissed about this, considering that she frequently claims to be a champion for equal pay. But, no.In fact, daddy s little girl actually backed her dad s decision. Ultimately, while I believe the intention was good and agree that pay transparency is important, the proposed policy would not yield the intended results,  Ivanka said.  We look forward to continuing to work with EEOC, OMB, Congress and all relevant stakeholders on robust policies aimed at eliminating the gender wage gap. Killing evidence-gathering rules actually kills the very transparency Trump claims is  important. Once again, Ivanka Trump proves that when it comes right down to it, she is a hypocrite and is complicit.Ivanka s betrayal of women and minorities drew a sharp rebuke from Twitter users.@IvankaTrump You re a sell out.

153,"Minnesota humorist Garrison Keillor just nailed Donald Trump in one of the best take-downs yet.Donald Trump is an insecure little man who thinks the presidency will finally make people respect him, and nobody made that clearer than Keillor, who wrote a column published on Wednesday that puts the Republican nominee in his place.Keillor begins by focusing on Trump s hat. The brim shadows your face, which gives a sinister look, as if you d come to town to announce the closing of the pulp factory,  he wrote.  Your eyes look dead and your scowl does not suggest American greatness so much as American indigestion. Keillor continued by pointing out that Trump has apparently been trying for his entire life to be liked and respected by the Manhattan elite.  The New York Times treats you like the village idiot,  Keillor wrote.  This is painful for a Queens boy trying to win respect in Manhattan When you came to Manhattan 40 years ago, you discovered that in entertainment, the press, politics, finance, everywhere you went, you ran into Jews, and they are not like you: Jews didn t go in for big yachts and a fleet of aircraft   they showed off by way of philanthropy or by raising brilliant offspring. They sympathized with the civil rights movement. In Queens, blacks were a threat to property values   they belonged in the Bronx, not down the street. To the Times, Queens is Cleveland. Bush league. You are Queens. The casinos were totally Queens, the gold faucets in your triplex, the bragging, the insults, but you wanted to be liked by Those People. This explains why Trump would throw his hat into the presidential ring. He is desperate for respect from his wealthy peers. Running for president is your last bid for the respect of Manhattan,  Keillor continued. If you were to win election, they couldn t ridicule you anymore. They could be horrified, but there is nothing ridiculous about being Leader of the Free World. You have B-52 bombers at your command. When you go places, a battalion of security guys comb the environs. You attract really really good speechwriters who give you Churchillian cadences and toss in quotes from Emerson and Aeschylus and Ecclesiastes. Keillor then went on to mock Trump over the bad month he had in August. The teleprompter is not your friend. You are in the old tradition of locker room ranting and big honkers in the steam room, sitting naked, talking man talk, griping about the goons and ginks and lousy workmanship and the uppity broads and the great lays and how you vanquished your enemies at the bank. Keillor concludes by pointing out that running for president is the hardest work Trump has ever done in his life and breaks the news to Donald that in the end he is going to lose and he won t get a damn thing he wanted. It s the hardest work you ve ever done. You walk out in the white cap and you rant for an hour about stuff that means nothing and the fans scream and wave their signs and you wish you could level with them for once and say one true thing: I love you to death and when this is over I will have nothing that I want. Donald Trump is currently imploding in the polls and his campaign continues fly off the rails even as he insists that he is winning and that everybody loves him.This is a man in serious denial and Keillor just hit him with the reality that he has always been a loser and will always be a loser.Featured image via Getty",0
1141,"So if natural disasters are sent by God to punish us for legalizing same-sex marriage, what does it mean when a flood destroys the home of one of the biggest anti-gay bigots in the country?That s the question that should be asked of Tony Perkins, since he is now living out of an RV because a flood drove him and his family out of their Louisiana home, forcing them to escape in a canoe.During a Family Research Council radio show on Wednesday, Perkins explained that once the water reached ten feet high his family loaded up in the boat and floated toward safety. They attempted to seek a place to stay but were denied by one shelter. So they sought refuge in the home of a former member of their church.Perkins is also still trying to figure out why God would smite his home. We re gonna look for what God s gonna do in this,  Perkins said.  I m asking those questions and I m going to see. Here s the audio via Raw Story.Usually, it s customary to feel sympathy for people who suffer losses due to flooding, but this is a special kind of irony that needs special commentary.As we all know, conservative  Christians  are constantly telling us that whenever there is an earthquake or a hurricane or a flood that it s punishment by God over homosexuality or abortion or some other social issue that has them all in a tizzy, especially when that natural disaster doesn t affect them personally.Now, the idea that God is sending natural disasters to punish people is complete bullshit, but let s just pretend for a moment that that is the case. The Perkins household just got severely damaged by a  flood of biblical proportions  as stated by Perkins himself, and they were driven out of their home.So by conservative logic, that must mean that he is being punished for something. And since Perkins is an anti-gay bigot who wants to suppress women s rights, one could easily surmise that God is sending Perkins a message to stop being a dick toward other human beings. You know, actually love your neighbor and treat others the way you want to be treated.But Perkins will likely fail to see that message. He ll just twist it to his own advantage. Because when it comes right down to it, conservative  Christians  think natural disasters are only sent to punish others, but when they are affected personally they believe it s only sent by God to test their faith. In other words, complete and total hypocrisy.The moral of the story, however, should be that conservatives should stop claiming that disasters are punishments by God, because there is a such thing as karma and Tony Perkins is learning that the hard way.Featured image via Wikimedia",0

The budget was planned and passed assuming the tax would hold.The tax was originally passed after the deadline for revenue raising bills, but Republican lawmakers tried to eke it through as a fee. A tax would have required a three-fourths majority to pass. Justices on Thursday ruled that, because the funds raised could be used for non-smoking related programs, the bill could not go through as a regulatory fee.The State now has a week to seek a rehearing.

931,"When listening to Donald Trump one really can t believe anything he actually says without tangible proof. Let s just say he s not the most honest fellow, and he s a guy who really likes to talk himself up, regardless of facts.One of the biggest falsifications of actual events that Trump has gotten caught doing is with his supposed donations to Veteran groups. Then when called out on these pretty blatant falsehoods by reporters, he verbally assaults them because he doesn t like people calling him out on his lies.Noticing these lies and misrepresentations of actualities is Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. Just imagine if it were her greatly exaggerating claims of raising money for Veterans and donations made by herself to organizations. She would get eaten alive by the press and it would likely be a major game-changer.Clinton called in live to CNN regarding Trump, and said: Well, I think the problem here is the difference between what Donald Trump says and what Donald Trump does. He s bragged for months about raising six million dollars for veterans and donating a million dollars himself. But it took a reporter to shame him into actually making his contribution and getting the money to Veterans. So, look, I m glad he finally did, but I don t know that he should get much credit for that. And she s absolutely correct, and it s likely very true that if Trump hadn t been called out then those donations probably still would not have been made.Donald Trump loves Donald Trump more than anyone else on this planet, and like everyone else, when someone goes after the one you love you may get brutally defensive, as we ve witnessed with the media scrutinization of Trump s supposed donations. And if he can t handle the scutinization from the press, how the hell is he going to handle being leader of the free world?Listen here: Hillary Clinton: Donald Trump was shamed into  actually making his contribution  to veterans https://t.co/6OZtrfIwim https://t.co/YBtMm3adVE  CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) May 31, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",0
821,"Linguistics professor and political commentator Noam Chomsky has come out with a shocking statement about the Republican party. We ve all known that Republicans are pretty much the scum of the earth today, but Chomsky warns they are the most dangerous organization  in human history. During an interview with BBC s  Newsnight  Wednesday with host Evan Davis, Mr. Chomsky quickly addressed the Republican Party, saying that they are worse than the Islamic State terrorist group or anyone else who have caused millions of casualties during the 20th century.Chomsky agreed his statement was outrageous but made it hit home when comparing the Republican part to ISIS.  Is ISIS dedicated to trying to destroy the prospects for organized human existence? He went on to explain,  What does it mean to say not only are we not doing anything about climate change, but we re trying to accelerate the race to the precipice?  he said.  It doesn t matter whether they genuinely believe it or not if the consequence of that is,  let s use more fossil fuels, let s refuse to subsidize developing countries, let s eliminate regulations that reduce greenhouse gases.  If that s the consequence, that s extremely dangerous. Chomsky has a real point. The rate at which the GOP is deregulating industry and ignoring the effects of climate change, the world will see levels of human suffering that have never been experienced in history.Watch the video here:",0
34,"Donald Trump has never been Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell s (R-KY) favorite person. That uneasy relationship deteriorated further in recent days and weeks, as Trump proceeded to openly mock and humiliate McConnell, blaming him for everything from the failed attempts to repeal Obamacare to the entire situation of the fractured GOP s stalled agenda. Now, since Trump had such a disgraceful response to the white supremacist violence in Charlottesville that resulted in the death of anti-racism activist Heather Heyer and the injuries of countless others, it seems that Trump and McConnell are engaged in what the New York Times is calling their own little, quote,  cold war. According to the new bombshell report, Trump doesn t even talk to McConnell   the one most important man in the legislative branch when it comes to getting his agenda passed. The New York Times reports: The relationship between President Trump and Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, has disintegrated to the point that they have not spoken to each other in weeks, and Mr. McConnell has privately expressed uncertainty that Mr. Trump will be able to salvage his administration after a series of summer crises.What was once an uneasy governing alliance has curdled into a feud of mutual resentment and sometimes outright hostility.The article further suggests that when Trump and McConnell were speaking, Trump didn t just keep his taunts to the usual juvenile derision via Twitter. No, apparently, on August 9th, McConnell and Trump had some kind of conversation, and Trump could not help going after McConnell to his face. There are no details regarding exactly what was said, but knowing Trump, it was likely pretty scathing and humiliating for McConnell, who seems to consider himself your typical dignified grown man. He is likely simply done with Trump s playground bully behavior and is no longer going to dignify Trump s ignorance and taunts with responses.It also doesn t help that McConnell s wife, Elaine Chao, is Trump s Transportation Secretary. She is an immigrant, and arrived from Taiwan as a child, speaking no English. Under Trump s new immigration plans, she would never have been allowed into this country. Further, to top it all off, Secretary Chao had to be humiliated standing next to Trump during his Charlottesville tirade, in which he defended white supremacists. Think about that   how it must have made McConnell feel to see his wife being used that way in such a despicable, bigoted, and unhinged Trump rant.All of this has resulted in much more criticism than one would expect from Mitch McConnell in public, but, according to the Times, McConnell is much more angry with Trump than he is letting on, and he is even wondering if Trump will be the GOP s leader for much longer, given his recent behavior. Again, from the New York Times:Mr. McConnell has fumed over Mr. Trump s regular threats against fellow Republicans and criticism of Senate rules, and questioned Mr. Trump s understanding of the presidency in a public speech. Mr. McConnell has made sharper comments in private, describing Mr. Trump as entirely unwilling to learn the basics of governing.In offhand remarks, Mr. McConnell has expressed a sense of bewilderment about where Mr. Trump s presidency may be headed, and has mused about whether Mr. Trump will be in a position to lead the Republican Party into next year s elections and beyond, according to people who have spoken to him directly.All in all, those two might never speak again. The thing is, though, Donald Trump has severely underestimated Mitch McConnell s power. The GOP took a chance and hitched their wagon to this ignorant, incompetent orange fool because their voters left them no choice. However, they now clearly regret it   and said regret just might be inching toward hastening Trump s removal from office.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",0
807,"The Trump administration has announced even more impediments to signing up for health insurance through Healthcare.Gov, the website set up during the creation of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. Donald Trump has been steadfast in his insistence that Obamacare is failing, despite a wealth of evidence that it is not. So to make it appear as though the ACA is on its last legs, Trump has devised multiple ways to ensure that enrollment is as hard as humanly possible.The latest scheme was first reported by Kaiser Health News  Phil Galewitz:..@HHSGov did a webinar with Assisters today, disclosing its plan to shut down @HHSGov on most Sundays during open enrollment season pic.twitter.com/fOF9AlKFo8  Phil Galewitz (@philgalewitz) September 22, 2017That s right: The Department of Health and Human Services, run by Tom Price, the man currently under intense scrutiny for his unethical use of taxpayer money to charter private jets for personal travel, has announced  downtimes  for the government website, and they are insane. All websites occasionally have downtime for maintenance, of course, but HHS is actually reserving 12 hours every single Sunday during open enrollment that the website will be inaccessible.HHS had already done their best to stifle participation in Obamacare by cutting the enrollment period in half and reducing advertising and promotional funds for the ACA by ninety percent. The Department also cut funding and grants for  navigators,  or health care specialists who help enrollees find coverage that s suitable for them, to the states by forty percent.The new roadblock means that, of the limited time working people actually have to get on the website and sign up, a huge chunk of free time has just been eliminated that could have been used. Make no mistake: The Trump administration knows that Sundays are the only day many Americans have free time. And the signup process, though easy, does take some time to complete.Just like his efforts toward voter suppression, Trump is using the power of the federal government to literally harm Americans who just want to avail themselves of a service that is offered. Hopefully the legions of people who benefit from the ACA who showed up at town halls across the country this summer understand that there is still nothing wrong with the system as it is   other than that it s not single-payer   and will remember Trump and the GOP s betrayal when they head to the voting booth next time.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",0
1172,"Ron Paul, who s a retired doctor, not an economist, has a prediction that in the very near future, the stock market will lose half its value. Guess who would be to blame? Why it s the black guy, of course. A 50 percent pullback is conceivable,  Paul said on  Futures Now  recently.  I don t believe it s ten years off. I don t even believe it s a year off. According to his calculations, it would cut the S&P 500 Index in half, to 1212, and the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average would collapse to 10,837.Paul noted that there s a lot of chaos in Washington right now, with an  unpredictable president  and those who are inclined to  tear him apart  but if the market takes that big of a tumble, he doesn t see it as Trump s fault. It s all man-made. It s not the fault of Donald Trump in the last week. If the market crashes tomorrow and we have a great depression, he didn t do it in six months. It took more like six or ten years to cause all these problems that we re facing,  he said.Source: CNBCSix to 10 years ago, hmmm, who was in office for the vast majority of that time?Paul has spent much of his career as an economic doomsdayer, and sometimes it sounds like he s right, just because, well, broken clocks and all Two years ago, he predicted nearly the same collapse, but he had a solution, which could be anyone s for just $49.50   for sale on his website, of course.As part of an infomercial for Stansberry & Associates Investment Research, Ron Paul warned that a currency crisis  of epic proportions  would arrive soon and prophesied that life in America was  guaranteed to end in disaster  as  a total breakdown of the stock market  would lead to  civil unrest  and  authoritarian clampdowns.  Paul said people could avoid   and even benefit from   the collapse by purchasing Stansberry s  Survival Blueprint  for weathering the coming catastrophe for $49.50.Source: CNNThe only thing Ron Paul hates more than regulations and the Federal Reserve, is a more diverse society. He s a long-avowed racist who was never a fan of President Obama. In March, Paul s institute ran a blog post that accused Obama of sabotaging Trump.He s also a big believer in the  Deep State,  which is a shadow government that really runs the United States. According to another blog post, Obama is still part of that deep state.A 50 percent drop in the stock market would be disastrous for our economy, but as I mentioned, Paul is not an economist. He arguably predicted the real estate crash, but so did a lot of economists. Paul, like his buddy Alex Jones, is full of doomsday predictions and he has books to sell. If such a drop happens, you might be able to point fingers at some Obama policies, but it s Trump who s scaring the hell out of everyone, including investors. If we crash, Trump is driving the bus and he will get the blame   at least from most people.Featured image via Pete Marovich/Getty Images",0
1171,"No one on earth has been a bigger cheerleader for Donald Trump than Fox News  Sean Hannity. In the wake of Monday s indictments of former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, Manafort s top aide Rick Gates and with a guilty plea of former economic advisor to Trump, George Papadopoulos, it appears the house of cards is beginning to collapse.Hannity, though, is ready with the pro-Trump propaganda. Immediately after the news of the indictment hit, Hannity was ready with his defense of Trump which means he s blaming Hillary:Not that there wasn t Russian collusion with a 2016 presidential candidate. It s just that her name was not Trump. We now have real evidence that the FBI uncovered a Russian plot dating back to 2009 that involved bribery, extortion, blackmail, money laundering and racketeering. It all came a year before Hillary Clinton and the Obama Administration approved the corrupt Uranium One deal. We have evidence of another Russia scandal, also involving a 2016 candidate not named Trump. We now know that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee paid over $9 million to help fund the discredited, Russia-linked dossier crafted to ruin then-candidate Donald Trump. This was nothing short of a collaborative effort with the Russians to manipulate the outcome of the last presidential election.Not surprisingly, Trump s statements are mirroring Hannity:Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren't Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 30, 2017  Only, Manafort was part of the Trump campaign during many of these alleged crimes and Hannity knows it.

Attacking  dying magazines , Trump said: After reading the false reporting and even ferocious anger in some dying magazines, it makes me wonder, WHY? All I want to do is #MAGA! Of course, let s for a second just ignore the fact that Trump loves painting himself as a victim, or the fact that several mainstream media networks are actually soaring and doing better than ever thanks to their anti-Trump reporting and coverage. It was the last line of Trump s ridiculous, whiny tweet where he stated  All I want to do is #MAGA  that gained the most attention   and the reactions were pretty damn hilarious. Here are just some of the best responses:   Apparently, Twitter users had a field day, as they often do whenever Trump displays how undeserving he is to be the leader of the free world. Trump never fails to humiliate America with his blatantly unprofessional behavior, and his Twitter account alone is a major source of anxiety and embarrassment for Americans throughout the country. As long as Trump has access to social media, he could humiliate or endanger the country at any moment and unfortunately, this behavior has become so common that we just expect this insanity from Trump on a daily basis now.Trump has done nothing to #MAGA, and shows no real genuine interest in improving the country beyond his own personal gain and that of his rich privileged friends.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",0
191,"One Nazi made the mistake of leaving his  safe space  at a rally featuring infamous Nazi Richard Spencer and learned, like Spencer did at Donald Trump s inauguration, that most Americans hate his kind and just want to punch him in the face.Punching Nazis has been a controversial issue among liberals, with some saying we should hug it out with them and it will magically erase the hate and the rest of us agreeing with our family members who fought in World War II that if you see a Nazi you should probably punch him (my grandfather didn t leave most of his hip in Europe so I could hug Nazis back home, for instance)   and while some members of a crowd of protesters worked to escort the Nazi to safety, at least one person did the right thing and punched him in the f*cking mouth.The self-defense strike (no violence against a Nazi can be rightfully considered an attack) occurred at a rally in Gainesville, Florida when a man wearing a t-shirt covered in swastikas tried to walk past a group of anti-racism demonstrators.

459,"In the age of oligarchy and near pandemic outbreaks of affluenza, it is truly refreshing to see a member of the rich and powerful class be held accountable for their crimes against humanity. On Thursday, a House of Representatives hearing with Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf provided the world with one of those rare and beautiful moments when a member of the bankster class was beaten into submission by our elected officials.During the hearing, which could be described a more of a verbal execution, Stumf was lambasted from all sides by those from the panel that he was brought before. Lawmakers such as  Rep. Mick Mulvaney, a Republican, chastised Stumpf for proving progressive Democrats correct in their goal to see stronger regulations be put in place within the banking industry.  To sit here and have to watch you essentially validate everything that the other side has said about you and your business and your industry, I don t know, for the last three or four generations, is extraordinarily disappointing to me,  Mulvaney said.  The damage that you have done to the market, to your industry, far exceed the damage that you ve done to your own business. Sean Duffy, another congressional Republican (even though he is a member of the GOP, he is an ally with Sen. Elizabeth Warren when it comes to certain financial industry reforms) perhaps provided one of the best moments in the hearing, where he forced Stumf to admit that his company had stolen from the American people. Stumpf tried to describe what Wells Fargo did in every single way he possibly could without using the word  steal.  That is, of course until Duffy laid into him. Was it theft?  Duffy asked. Pardon me?  Stumph responded. Was it theft? Did you steal?  Duffy pressed. Our people did not do what was right,  Stumpf said evading the word. My question is, did you steal? I want to make sure you and I are on the same page. Did Wells Fargo employees steal from a million to two million customers? Yes or no?   In some cases. They did. Yes,  Stumph finally admitted.Here s a clip:[ad3media campaign= 974 ]Don t think for a moment that Republicans were the only ones to hammer the CEO. Massachusetts Democratic Representative Mike Capuano offered the coldest words of the panel members to Stumph.  You think today is tough? When the prosecutors get a hold of you, you re going to have a lot of fun,  Capuano said.If the 2016 election has proven one thing, it s that the people of the United States are out for blood. This new wave of populism has manifested itself in horrifying ways on the right-wing, mostly in the form of Donald Trump s ascension as the GOP s presidential nominee. That being said, Congress needs to take a cue from the people and begin to work together to right the wrongs of banking and financial deregulation. Center Republicans and Democrats must join together with progressive lawmakers today. The bipartisanship witnessed within Thursday s hearing can be the start of a new movement within Congress. After all, as Mulvaney half-heartedly conceded   the actions of Wells Fargo have proven that progressives have been correct in their calls for new regulations in the banking industry for decades. Yesterday, I would have believed a unicorn sighting is more plausible than to hear those words.

842,"According to a family friend, Barack Obama has plans for that D.C. mansion he rented   and Trump is not going to like what they are. No longer the most powerful man in the world, he was just observing Trump and not liking what he saw,  the friend says. The goal is to oust Trump either by forcing him to resign or orchestrating his impeachment. According to the source, even longtime Obama confidante Valerie Jarrett is coming back to help get rid of Trump, taking up residence in a suite of rooms in Obama s home. He was weary and burned out after eight years in office. But Valerie convinced him that he didn t have any choice if he wanted to save his legacy,  the friend says.  And, as usual, he bowed to Valerie s political wisdom and advice. There was never any doubt that Valerie would have a suite of rooms in the house that the Obama s are renting,  said the source.  Obama trusts her judgment more than any other person on the planet, as does Michelle. Obama doesn t make a decision without her. He is going to use his immense popularity with the half of the country that identifies as liberals and progressives. Millions of Americans are energized and ready to take to the streets to oppose Trump, but they need to be organized and have their anger focused and directed,  says the source.  Obama is dismayed at the way Trump is tearing down his legacy ObamaCare, the social safety net and the welcome mat for refugees he put in place.  He is also not fond of Trump s cabinet picks   particularly notorious racist Jeff Sessions. He had hoped to write his memoirs, golf to his heart s content. and bask in the glory of his eight years in power and the progressive achievements he brought about. Instead, he is going to be leading the fight and strategy to topple Trump,  says the family friend.Recently, former Attorney General Eric Holder heralded the President s return: It s coming. He s coming. And he s ready to roll. This is really a battle for our democracy,  Holder says of Jeff Sessions  recent decision to no longer challenge discriminatory voting laws.  The notion that people are denied their ability to cast a meaningful vote  is inconsistent with who we say we are, inconsistent with what we say our democracy is about. Naturally, conservatives want Obama investigated and locked up or even killed  for unspecified and/or nonsensical reasons:       Trump fans are scared (and just as racist as ever). As easily the most popular President in modern history, if anyone stands a chance of successfully leading the fight against President Asterisk, it s him.",0

1214,"I ll bet most Americans have no idea that we re in another huge housing bubble thanks to Obama s desire for everyone to own a home. Remember Barney Frank and his pals forcing this bubble to get bigger and bigger and then pointing the finger at Republicans? Well, that s what s next unless the lame Republicans take the bull by the horns and get control of our debt. BILL CLINTON S HUD SECRETARY ANDREW CUOMO DISCUSSING FAIR HOUSING: THIS IS A MASSIVE SHELL GAME THAT OBAMA CONTINUES:Just this September, HUD  awarded $38 million to  fight housing discrimination  so the shell game continues but here s more of the rest of the story:OBAMA S HOUSE OF CARDS:  Eric Holder and Tom Perez who re Obama administration political shills, did the dirty work in targeting banks. The excerpt below is from a fantastic piece in the New York Post that spells out the Obama administration s efforts with minority home ownership and  perceived injustices  that just aren t there. Typical Obama to rewrite the rules or just not follow them to get what you want. That isn t stopping the administration from trying to correct perceived injustices. Cordray says CFPB will rewrite the rules for how the private credit bureaus collect, maintain and analyze such data. He is working on  reforming  the system with the liberal Center for Responsible Lending and other housing activists who believe it denies minorities the credit they deserve. The federal government also isn t shy about fining and suing banks to get its way. CFPB also has been working closely with the Justice Department to enhance fair lending enforcement. Justice has pressured banks to relax their mortgage underwriting standards and approve loans for minorities with poor credit as part of a new crackdown on alleged discrimination, court documents show. Attorney General Eric Holder, who served as Reno s deputy, has filed a record number of fair-lending enforcement actions against lenders. More than 60 investigations are active or said to be in the pipeline, and dozens of banks have already settled, including giants Wells Fargo and Bank of America. Prosecutions have already generated more than $550 million in rebates, loan set-asides and other subsidies from banks that have settled out of court rather than battle the federal government and risk being branded racist by the media. Leading the charge is Holder s top civil-rights cop, Thomas Perez, another Clinton retread. Perez has compared bankers to Klansmen, arguing that while bankers may discriminate  with a smile  and  fine print,  it s  every bit as destructive as the cross burned in a neighborhood. STEPHEN MOORE: The Fed, the White House and Congress are setting up the next financial bubbleMy 13-year-old son told me at the dinner table the other day that Franklin Roosevelt was one of America s  greatest presidents  because  he ended the Great Depression.  He s usually a good student, so I checked where he got this tripe and sure enough the fairy tale was right there in his American history book.Sure enough his text book tells kids that the New Deal ended the Great Depression and even saved capitalism. Of course the New Deal exacerbated the pain and financial devastation of a stock market crash, and unemployment lingered in double digits for a decade after Roosevelt was elected until the start of World War II.Here s the latest story line: bailouts, trillions of dollars of government spending and debt, easy money, and re-regulation of Wall Street ended the 2008 Great Recession. The myth took on new life last week when Ben Bernanke took a bow in The Wall Street Journal for in his mind saving the economy with his $3 trillion of quantitative easing and zero interest rate policy. No, actually this is what created the crisis. Don t be surprised if Mr. Bernanke receives a Nobel Peace Prize.As Peter Wallison of the American Enterprise Institute and other scholars have thoroughly documented, the crash of 2008 was caused by the Federal Reserve s easy money policies for nearly a decade, government housing policies that led to preposterous mortgage loans being issued, and massive overleverage of government, companies, and households.Why does any of this history matter? Since Washington doesn t understand what went wrong in 2007 and 2008, so the Fed, the White House and Congress are recreating the very same conditions for another financial bubble. If it pops, we could replay the same devastating effects as occurred during the first bubble in 1999 and 2000. It is doing so in four ways:First, the Dodd-Frank regulations are causing one of the greatest consolidations of the banking industry since the Great Depression. Those indispensable small savings and loans that Jimmy Stewart operated in the movie  It s a Wonderful Life  are disappearing from the American landscape. This is because only really big banks have the size to spread the costs of Dodd-Frank compliance officers and costs. So we have created a competitive advantage that allows the sharks to swallow the minnows. Meanwhile, the  too big to fail  safety net to Bank of America, Citi, and other titans exacerbates this cost advantage of big banks and thus makes bailouts even more likely in the future.Second, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are engaged in the same low interest rate lending mania of 2004-07 and the Obama administration is on a Bush-like home-ownership push. Some Republican House heroes like Jeb Hensarling of Texas wanted to eliminate taxpayer subsidies to Fannie and Freddie but the housing lobby kept them alive. So now the two government enterprises are back issuing taxpayer guarantees on mortgages with as little as 3 percent down payment. Have we learned nothing at all?Third, the Fed refused to raise interest rates off zero in September, and, hello, that easy money policy is how we got into the mess in 2000 and then in 2008. Wall Street cheered Janet Yellen s decision to keep the cheap dollars flowing. Isn t this all starting to sound familiar?Finally, there is the saturation of debt. When the crisis hit in 2008 the national debt stood at a little under $10 trillion. Now we are at $18 trillion. Government is hopelessly overleveraged. The interest rate exposure is enormous with each one percentage point rise in long term rates causing the servicing costs of the debt to rise by about $1 trillion over 10 years. Meanwhile, on top of that, the Fed owns at least $1 trillion in mortgage debt and so if housing markets fall again, taxpayers get double walloped.The point is that government and politicians have no learning curve. All of the conditions of financial wreckage are reappearing. This is why congressional Republicans absolutely should put up a fight on the debt ceiling by requiring more budget discipline as a condition of higher debt levels. They should require at least 8-10 percent downpayments on all government insured mortgages. They should repeal all or part of the Dodd-Frank bill that is destroying community banks, while promising voters they will never again bail out a bank or financial institution. Finally, they should be urging the Fed to restore sound money by gradually raising short term interest rates. And the presidential candidates should start warning voters that Washington is rebuilding another financial house of cards.If they don t, when the financial crash comes and Americans see their life savings disappear, the media and the history books will again blame Republicans for the destruction from the rampant financial negligence of government.

1030,"As crunch time nears and states are having their primary contests, the Clinton campaign is wasting no time in getting further ahead than the Republicans.In a new report detailed by Politico, Hillary Clinton and her campaign are setting course to raise over $1 billion to unseat vulnerable House and Senate Republicans, with the aim of knocking off 10 to 25 House seats from Republicans and taking back the Senate.Hillary Clinton will raise $1 billion for Democrats and the party will train some of their efforts   and that money   on defeating House and Senate Republicans. Party leaders privately concede that the Senate could be lost either way. But senior House Republicans say they re in good shape across the country, and see no evidence that the control of the chamber is in playRepublicans are especially antsy at these revelations, considering the Republican National Committee fell almost $10 million short in their July fundraising predications (they only conjured up $27 million). In that same month, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the fundraising arm of the Democratic National Committee, raised over $35 million (not including the total $90 million in joint fundraising with Clinton), and has raised almost $20 million more than the RNC for the 2016 fiscal year so far.In contrast, Trump had a very good month for fundraising. Counter that with the RNC s pathetic monthly numbers, the money speaks for itself: the GOP is putting its trust (and money) in Trump and Trump alone.So while Trump is hurting down-ballot candidates and their efforts for re-election, Clinton is set to raise unprecedented amounts of money for the Democrats, all while having her own campaign to fund.Back in May 2015, Politico reported that Clinton s campaign sought to raise over $2 billion by the time the November general election rolled around. Considering the Clinton campaign has raised, per OpenSecrets, $375 million for her own personal campaign, $100 million in 2015 for down-ballot candidates in 2015, and over $60 million through the summer of 2016 (coupled with the goal of $1 billion by November), that leaves the campaign roughly $465 million off target.Still, the Clinton machine is dominating Republicans in fundraising, not just for the presidential candidate, but for everyone else involved.Clinton is serious about getting stuff done   she knows her policies will be  pie-in-the-sky  without support from Congress. So what does she do? She raises more money for other Democrats than she does for herself. Trump, on the other hand, hoards the money for himself while he s a billionaire. See how that concentration of wealth screws everyone over, Republicans? Ironic, isn t it.Featured image Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",0

942,"In perhaps the clearest example of the small, but egregious way Donald Trump lies about even the little things, he got caught screwing up less than 2 seconds after announcing that he  doesn t make mistakes. It unfolded like a scene from a comedy, Trump, angry at his plummeting poll numbers and numerous scandals, complained that the press were obsessed with looking for flaws in his White House. Rather than admit he s only human, Trump doubled down on his absurd contention that he s never wrong. One mistake and it s no good. But we just can t make mistakes, right? So we don t make mistakes. Ready for the punchline?Trump next passes the conversation over to  Ken. Go ahead, Ken. That wasn t  Ken.  That s Chuck Canterbury, the head of the National Fraternal Order of Police.Oops.While flatly stating that you never make mistakes is a ridiculous thing to lie about, it only serves to highlight the general level of dishonesty that is rampant in Trump s White House. He s so incapable of admitting he s wrong that Trump goes to great lengths to never apologize for anything he s ever said   no matter how false. Trump never apologized for linking Ted Cruz s dad to the JFK assassination. His  apology  for six years of promoting birtherism turned out to be a  sorry, not sorry  publicity stunt. He can t even admit his unfounded claim that Obama wiretapped his phones was a complete fabrication.But here s the really scary part. A lie as obvious as  I never make mistakes  brings us to an unsettling truism: If a person will lie about the little things, what will he do to cover up the big ones?Featured image via YouTube",0

458,"On top of all the problems this country faces under a Donald Trump administration, anti-vaxxers are hoping he ll make widespread disease great again.Anti-vaccination advocates literally believe that vaccines are harmful to children despite an avalanche of scientific research and the fact that we have nearly eradicated many viruses that used to kill thousands of people as proof to the contrary.Leading anti-vaxxer Andrew Wakefield, the moron who made parents panic by claiming to link vaccines to autism, got to meet with Trump to spew the same fraudulent claims that cost him his medical license. For the first time in a long time, I feel very positive about this, because Donald Trump is not beholden to the pharmaceutical industry,  Wakefield said.  He didn t rely upon [drug makers] to get him elected. And he s a man who seems to speak his mind and act accordingly. So we shall see. Now Americans have to fear a world where anyone around them could be carrying a disease that could have been easily prevented by a harmless vaccine because Trump is listening to a crackpot.Thus far, the anti-vaxxer movement has caused outbreaks of whooping cough, rubella, and measles, just to name a few. Measles had been declared eradicated in 2000, but after many parents had a collective freak-out they stopped vaccinating their damn kids and opened the door for measles and other diseases to return. Measles kicked that door down in 2015 when the disease struck many who were unvaccinated after a visitor from another country carried it and spread it to others at Disneyland.At the height of the outbreak, Fox medical expert Dr. Marc Siegel blasted anti-vaxxers and defended vaccines as necessary for the public health. Let me be clear on this, I see no debate whatsoever,  Siegel said.  Period. This is the greatest vaccine that has ever been created in the history of vaccines. You know we stamped out measles in the United States in 2000. It was incredible because measles is the most contagious virus known to man. If you had measles there would be a 90 percent chance that I would get it by sitting next to you if I weren t vaccinated. It s so much more contagious than the flu. We were talking about Ebola, this is a million times more contagious than Ebola! Your celebrities did not go to medical school! In California, there s 13,000 parents that are taking a personal belief exemption, allowing their kids to go to school without that second MMR vaccine. You need one after you re 1 year old, and then you need one again before you re 5 or 6 years old. I think these parents are putting children at risk in schools. I think schools should consider not allowing these kids in. Make them be homeschooled if they don t have this vaccine. Why should my child be a risk because your child isn t vaccinated? Later that year, the first American in over a decade died after contracting measles.And if Donald Trump aids anti-vaxxers by changing federal policy, he will become a direct threat to the public health as it becomes more likely that diseases once considered eradicated in this country thanks to vaccines return with a deadly vengeance all because we let a bunch of stupid people who reject science influence policy.Featured Image: MNN",0

983,"President Donald Trump announced yesterday that he plans to formally recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. While this is left most pundits perplexed, the reasoning is clear. Trump wants to divert attention from Robert Mueller s investigation. It is no coincidence that the day after the news broke that Deutsche Bank has received subpoenas for information on the Trump family s assets, that this Jerusalem decision was announced. What could be a bigger news story than getting this information? A blow up in the Middle East.Look at the reaction world leaders have had to this announcement. American allies throughout the Middle East and Europe have asked Trump not to do this and have stressed how dangerous a statement this is. US News and World Report put this out today: The mere consideration of Trump changing the status quo sparked a renewed U.S. security warning on Tuesday. America s consulate in Jerusalem ordered U.S. personnel and their families to avoid visiting Jerusalem s Old City or the West Bank, and urged American citizens in general to avoid places with increased police or military presence. It is worth noting that while Trump will formally announce that the U.S. will recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital, there is no movement underway to relocate the embassy from Tel Aviv. In fact, he has signed an order to delay that decision for another six months. This move is necessary due to the 1995 Jerusalem Embassy Act, which mandated the embassy be moved. It also allowed the president to delay that by six months and every president since that act became law has done so this way.The Atlantic has even compared this decision to Trump  wagging the dog,  a reference to a movie where a U.S. president goes to war with Albania to take the public s attention away from his own scandals involving a mistress. The film was viewed as a parody of President Bill Clinton s military actions in Afghanistan and Sudan after he acknowledged an affair with Monica Lewinsky.While whether or not Clinton attacked other countries to distract the nation from his actions with Lewinsky may be a point that is up for debate, it is clear that Trump likes to do things to distract the public s attention. Catherine Rampell wrote about this tactic late last year in the Washington Post. She wrote: Welcome to 2017, the ouroboros of distractions, where every terrible thing is a head-fake for a ruse for a diversion for a misdirection from something else much, much worse. Trump makes announcements, sends tweets and says things without any thought to the real world consequences that follow. Experts in the Middle East fear that the Jerusalem announcement will lead to real deaths. Many people worry  that his thoughtless and impetuous tweets will lead to a nuclear war. His thoughtless comments confuse and enrage many.By making such a move, for such purely personal reasons, Trump is proving, once again, that he is not fit to be president of a condo association, much less of the United States.Featured image by Andrew Burton/Getty Images.",0

Despite that, they brutally pinned him to the ground and cuffed him, according to the Council on American Islamic Relations, and police body-cam footage seems to confirm that. They were supposedly following standard protocol until they discovered that al Menhali was, in fact, totally unarmed. No bombs, no guns, no nothing.Below is the body-cam video from one of the responding officers:This is what Republicans have wrought upon society with their ongoing fear-mongering regarding Muslims and terrorism. They spout disgusting, ignorant rhetoric, and then morons like this hotel clerk, who clearly buy into everything bad they hear about Muslims, call the cops on totally innocent people.What s worse is that the right-wing pundits who spew forth this racist rhetoric would likely be fired if they said it about Jews or Christians, but noooooooooo. If they re talking about Islam, then they believe all is well. Despite efforts from some of our leaders, including George W. Bush, to try and separate the religion of Islam from terrorism, we still have people like His Royal Islamophobe, King Trump, along with Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee, and others, stoking irrational, paranoid fires like they ll freeze instantly if they don t.We re also getting good at pissing countries right the hell off with this crap. The UAE was sorely disappointed that one of their citizens was treated this way for zero reason, to the point where their government called up our deputy mission chief (i.e., the Department of State) over there about the  brutal   ill-treatment meted out by the Ohio Police to an Emirati citizen.  They were apparently told that we respect the right of foreign nationals to wear clothing in accordance with their traditions and views, but it s patently obvious that we don t, all because of what if. The UAE also felt they had to send out a warning to their citizens traveling abroad: For citizens traveling outside the country, and in order to ensure their safety, we point out not to wear formal dress while traveling, especially in public places.  [emphasis mine]That sounds an awful lot like telling women to dress more modestly if they don t want to be raped. How about we actually stop teaching people that all Muslims are terrorists? One single hotel clerk from a small town managed to cause an international hassle thanks to GOP fear-mongering.

Miscommunication our lily-white asses. This was a result of the blatant racism and Islamophobia that Republicans with miniature brains, and their frightened, paranoid, xenophobic little mouthpieces, have sown here. This hotel clerk should be fired at the bare minimum, she and her family should face charges, and Republicans need to stop their racist fuckery and accept responsibility for creating an environment that leads to ordinary people in small towns creating international problems.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",0
652,"21st Century Wire says Here s a classic case of Problem, Reaction, Solution How far will the federal government go to dismantle the US Constitution? Back in 2000, the establishment rigged the US Presidential Election and made Florida and its notorious pregnant chads the centerpiece of that artificial controversy. Predictably, the public reaction is outrage. Suddenly, there are calls nationwide for electronic voting as the solution to the old  inefficient  paper ballot system.Now that electronic voting is all-pervasive in the US, the next problem becomes  cyber security    which the government is referring to as the next burning national security issue.Enter the relatively new and prohibitively expensive Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which ironically (or not) was created by one George W. Bush   a president who was installed into power not by the popular vote, but by a dubious Supreme Court decision in that very same 2000 US Presidential Election. Now DHS head and Obama appointee Jeh Johnson, is nudging towards the idea of the domestic military force taking over the election process. Johnson claims that US elections are part of the country s vital infrastructure and therefore it must be under the control of an already bloated federal agency.What is wrong with a decentralized, traditional paper ballot system? If you are in the business of fixing elections, the answer is simple: paper is too difficult, sloppy and complicated... to hack.It s no coincidence at all that this latest power-grab by the federal government comes immediately after a mainstream conspiracy theory that Russia was somehow behind this week s election database  hack  in Arizona (once again, Putin did it). No proof has been offered by either politicians or media anchors presently parroting this latest sensational plot.Looking back, we can see now that years of excessive lobbying by Washington insider firms eager tosecure lucrative contracts  by implementing a myriad of fatally flawed electronic voting systems  was not a mere accident of nature. It was designed for this very police state end-run we see now.The only problem is that this would be unconstitutional, but does this government really care about constitutional law?Not when you are erecting a police state Barbara Hollingsworth CNS NewsHomeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson s suggestion that state and local voting systems be designated as  pieces of critical infrastructure  so that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) can protect them from hackers is unconstitutional and would create a dangerous precedent, legal experts said. The Department of Homeland Security does not have the legal authority to interfere with states  election systems without their permission,  University of California/Berkeley School of LawProfessor John Yoo told CNSNews.com. While the federal government has the general power to protect the nation s cyber infrastructure, it cannot intrude into areas of state sovereignty without clear constitutional mandate. Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution recognizes the authority of the states to regulate the times, places, manner of elections, subject to congressional regulation. As far as I am aware, Congress has not clearly decided to regulate the information systems of state electoral systems or delegated this authority to DHS,  Yoo noted Continue this story at CNS NewsREAD MORE POLICE STATE NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Police State Files",0

193,"Donald Trump practically does something to criticize the media as being  fake news  on an almost daily basis, but two major news networks have just turned the tables and put him on blast in a major way.The White House is currently up in arms over a recent decision by CNN and MSNBC, who decided not to air Trump s insanely dishonest North Dakota speech from earlier today. Trump was supposed to address tax reform in his speech, but there was a major problem with what he was saying   not a word of it was true. In response to this fact-free speech, CNN and MSNBC decided that it was irresponsible to air the speech and decided to spare Americans the misinformation and nonsense.Once the Trump administration found out about this move by the press, the White House practically threw a hissy fit. Special Assistant to the President and Assistant White House Communications Director Steven Chueng tweeted:Instead of insulting their viewers with Trump s lies, MSNBC s Nicole Wallace reported on important, truthful topics such as DACA and Russia. CNN s Jake Tapper focused on Hurricane Irma, Russia, and the debt ceiling while Trump spewed his usual nonsense.This was a major f*ck you to the Trump administration and sends a strong message that the dishonest narrative that his administration continues to put out to the American people will not be tolerated. While people aren t likely going to react so strongly to a topic as dry as tax reform, having two major networks refusing to air his speech is a big deal. Trump desperately wants and needs that coverage, and is obviously pissed that all eyes were not on him. If more cable news networks break from Trump, his already failing presidency will be in even more danger.Featured image is a screenshot",0

463,"When Donald Trump allowed popular Nazi blog The Gateway Pundit to have a correspondent show up at the White House, many questioned that decision   but if The Donald was going for comic relief, we re forced to admit that the inclusion of Lucian Wintrich is a complete success.Recently, the White House reporter followed up on a hot tip he received from noted Twitter political sociologist guy Krang T. Nelson informing America that  Antifa  (a blanket term for people who oppose fascism) is breeding a team of super soldiers (yes, like in Marvel comics) which they will unleash on America in a devastating attack on white people   a first strike in a new civil war he reported on completely seriously in a now-disappeared scare piece. Can t wait for November 4th when millions of antifa supersoldiers will behead all white parents and the small business owners in the town square,  Krang tweeted   an obvious joke, unless you re a f*cking idiot.Enter Wintrich, who reported it completely seriously then threw a massive tantrum when the obviously humorous comment turned out to be fake.In addition, a bunch of right-wingers mass reported Krang s post and got him suspended from Twitter. Anyone with a single crease in their brain could see that my post was satire, but alas, the internet has no shortage of morons, and the tweet was apparently reported into oblivion,  Krang T. Nelson said of the attack in an op-ed he wrote for Vice.  The ensuing suspension was so thorough that my work account was axed for using the same phone number. (I reached out to Twitter for comment in connection with this story, but had yet to hear back at the time of publication.) It s worth noting that Donald Trump has not once been suspended from Twitter.Unfortunately, this is common fare for the Stupid Part of America. They genuinely believe that Hillary Clinton is running a child sex slavery operation out of the basement of a pizza restaurant that doesn t even have a basement, that  antifa  is going to murder white women, or even that Malia Obama got herself arrested buying six pounds of marijuana and somehow managed to fit it into a Prada handbag. But when the truth comes out they blame the people who are laughing at them instead of themselves for being so goddamn stupid.Wintrich is just the latest example that the Party of Fake News and personal responsibility produces the majority of the former and has no sense of the latter.Featured image via screengrab",0

The contract says that  in no event  may the government audit or review the cost and profit elements  under the agreement, allowing complete secrecy about how the $300 million handed to the company is spent.In addition, both of the  very fine people  who will be doing the work will be given $332 per day for accommodations   way more than the average hotel in Puerto Rico   as well as a luxurious $80 per day for food. Supervisors will be paid $462 per hour and linemen will receive $319 per hour   a pretty sweet deal for the two-year-old company, which has ties to the Trump administration.Whitefish contract states, ""In no event shall [government bodies] have the right to audit or review the cost and profit elements.""

Do you want us to send them back or keep working? They are threatening not to do their job which frankly is quite irregular for a company hired to the work for the public sector, the Mayor replied. The contract should be voided right away and a proper process which is clear, transparent, legal, moral and ethical should take place,  Cruz told Yahoo News.The deal is so horrible that even Republicans on the House Natural Resources Committee have a problem with it. The size and terms of the contract, as well as the circumstances surrounding the contract s formation, raise questions regarding PREPA s standard contract awarding procedures,  wrote Reps. Rob Bishop and Bruce Westerman on Thursday.Whitefish says it welcomes investigations into the shady deal: Whitefish Energy appreciates the efforts of the committees to gather information so that they have confidence in the overall process to support the people of Puerto Rico as well Whitefish Energy s capabilities and commitment to deliver on the contract to help restore power and a sense of normalcy for the people of Puerto Rico. Previously, Whitefish s largest government contract was when they received $1.3 million  to upgrade power lines in Arizona.With a contract that throws money at the company with no oversight and no guarantee that work will be completed in a timely manner, this is probably a mistake.featured image via screengrab",0

961,"The average American makes about $50,000 a year   and too many Americans scrape by on much less. So how much does Trump pay his staff? According to the public filing of payroll released by the White House, an absurd amount, apparently.Since taking office, Trump has staffed his White House with a number of unquestionably unqualified people   including former reality tv stars. His only job requirement is that they be loyal to him   and he measures that loyalty in how well they lie for him on television. The most opportunistic of his staff has risen to that challenge and he subsequently paid them handsomely for the job. Of Trump s staff, a few people stick out for the ridiculous amount of money they make for doing, essentially, nothing:Omarosa, who was hired by Trump because she appeared on  The Apprentice  with him, makes $179,700 per year. It s entirely unclear what she does exactly. Likewise with scandal-laden Seb Gorka, who gets paid $155,000 but legally can t do the job Trump hired him for because he s so shady that intelligence officials wouldn t give him security clearance. Instead, he hangs out at the White House and collects a paycheck.Kellyanne Conway and Sean Spicer both get paid the same $179,700 that Omarosa does, but that money covers not only their jobs and expenses but also their human dignity. Both Trump staffers are required to repeatedly and shamelessly lie and defend Trump no matter what indefensible thing he said or did. Spicer at least has the decency to look like the toll is killing him inside. Conway appears to actually enjoy the dishonesty, and one suspects she would probably do the job for free if she had to.Hilariously, former Fox News host K.T. MacFarlane gets paid the same amount that Trump s top staff does, including Reince Priebus. She has been sidelined since her friend Michael Flynn was booted from his job and his replacement, H.R. McMasters told Trump he wouldn t take the job unless she was removed. Now she putters around the White House under the vague title  Assistant to the President  doing who knows what. For that, she earns $179,700.The release of the White House payroll only goes to show just how cartoonish Trump s administration is. Filled with disgraced lobbyists, Fox News hosts, former reality tv stars, and a variety of other opportunistic liars, it s no wonder the White House barely functions and is plagued with in-fighting, backstabbing, and scandals. It turns out, if you hire a bunch of clowns, the West Wing can fit an awful lot of them inside.

984,"This is yet another egregious abuse of power.If the Supreme Court caves in to Donald Trump s latest demands, it will truly be the end of the rule of law as we know it.Two weeks ago, a 17-year-old migrant (known as Jane Doe in court records) sought an abortion but was denied the procedure by the Trump Administration.The government forced her to remain in a refugee center in Texas rather than allow her to exercise a constitutional right.So the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) took the Trump Administration to court and asked the judge to grant their client the ability to seek the medical care she needed.To make a long story short, she won. And she won again when the Trump Administration appealed. The girl then went to a doctor and got an abortion.But, of course, this made the Trump Administration angry.Despite the fact that the girl legally received an abortion, Trump s Justice Department is throwing a temper tantrum because they think the girl should have informed them so that they could block her by appealing to a higher court. This was a total surprise. And we re disturbed about it,  disgraced Attorney General Jeff Sessions whined.Let s make this clear. The girl had the abortion following a ruling by a federal appeals court judge that granted her request to seek the procedure. She did not have to wait nor did she have to inform the government. It is the government s responsibility to file appeals quickly. But the Trump Administration did not file quick enough.And now the Trump Administration is demanding that the Supreme Court punish the ACLU lawyers for winning their case and helping their client get the abortion she wanted.According to the Tribune Washington Bureau,On Friday, new Solicitor General Noel Francisco filed an appeal that asks the Supreme Court to set aside the lower court s rulings and to consider  disciplinary action  against the ACLU.They  kept the government in the dark about when Ms. Doe was scheduled to have an abortion,  he told the justices.  Given the extraordinary circumstances  of the case, the court should consider sanctions against one or more of the ACLU lawyers, he said.Trump s Administration is stooping to a new low. The Supreme Court should not be used as a tool to punish or attack lawyers who help their clients win. The ACLU won their case twice and their client exercised her right to have an abortion in accordance with the court decision. They were not required to inform the federal government. That would have been a violation of their client s privacy. If the Trump Administration wanted to appeal, they should have done it much faster instead of expecting a teen girl and her lawyers to keep them informed about her every move.ACLU legal director David Cole reacted strongly to Trump s demand. This administration has gone to astounding lengths to block this young woman from getting an abortion. After the courts cleared the way for her to get her abortion, it was the ACLU s job as her lawyers to see that she wasn t delayed any further   not give the government another chance to stand in her way. Our lawyers acted in the best interest of our client and in full compliance with court orders and federal and Texas law. That government lawyers failed to seek judicial review quickly enough is their fault, not ours. If the conservative Justices on the Supreme Court go along with this demand, it will only further erode the credibility of the court and our justice system. And Trump would have a new weapon to use against anyone who opposes him in a court of law.Featured Image: Alex Wong/Getty Images",0

42,"Sean Hannity threw a massive temper tantrum on Monday night in defense of Donald Trump.The Fox News host went off on a seriously delusional rant about Hillary Clinton, even referring to her as  President Clinton  on two occasions.Hannity whined about the indictments against Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, and just like Donald Trump, attempted to shift the focus from Trump s Russia collusion to Hillary Clinton. This is beyond insanity and it s inexcusable,  Hannity whined.  Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, the Obama Administration allowed your national security to be compromised in what is an unprecedented way and few in the media will touch this story. Major crimes were committed. They knew about it. They did nothing before the deal. Hannity is referring to the Uranium One deal the Obama Administration made with Russia back in 2010. Trump himself has been bellowing about it for quite some time now in a desperate effort to distract from his very real crimes.Basically, the deal gave a Russian company no more than a 51 percent stake in a Canadian-based mining company and ownership of  20 percent of the currently licensed uranium in-situ recovery production capacity in the U.S. This deal does not harm our national security as Hannity claims, nor did Hillary Clinton personally approve of the deal. Factcheck.org recently gave a run-down of the deal and thoroughly debunked Trump and Hannity s claims. As we ve written before, there is no evidence that donations to the Clinton Foundation from people with ties to Uranium One or Bill Clinton s speaking fee influenced Hillary Clinton s official actions,  FactCheck.org wrote.  That s still the case. In fact, not only did such a deal require approval from several federal agencies and committees, only 11 percent of overall U.S. production of uranium comes from Uranium One. And that uranium is sold to operators of commercial nuclear reactors. Basically, the uranium is being sold to us as it would have if Uranium One was not held by a Russian company. This deal was under a lot of scrutiny before it went through, and was even publicly announced. But Hannity did not utter one word about it when it happened.Of course, Hannity is still insisting that the evidence is on Trump s side despite the fact that there is a lot of evidence proving that he and Trump are full of shit and that Trump committed treason to steal an election. We are at a major crisis point in America tonight. Do we have equal justice under the law in this country today? If you or I or anybody in this room with me now or watching TV with you, if we ever did anything close to what the Clintons, the DNC, and others did, we would be rotting in a jail cell tonight hoping our friends would send us a cake that had a file. The only difference between Trump/Russia collusion is that we have the evidence, and after a year of black helicopter conspiracy theories, they have none. And just like we have the evidence, when it comes to Clinton and her email server scandal, why hasn t she been charged? Here s the video via YouTube.Hillary Clinton has not been charged because she didn t commit any crimes and there is ZERO evidence that she did. Trump, on the other hand, is about to go down for collusion.Clearly, nobody gives Trump a blowjob like Sean Hannity. And frankly, he and Fox News should be sued for slander.Featured Image: Screenshot",0

464,"The winners of the 2017 Pulitzer Prize have been announced and this year s theme was all about exposing Trump.Of particular note was the prize for National Reporting going to David A. Fahrenthold of The Washington Post, whose contribution to reporting during the presidential campaign was to unflinchingly go after Trump s lies, particularly as they related to his contributions to charity.As the Pulitzer committee put it, Fahrenthold deserved the award:For persistent reporting that created a model for transparent journalism in political campaign coverage while casting doubt on Donald Trump s assertions of generosity toward charities.During a campaign when many reporters and pundits struggled to keep up with Trump s lies, or pretended Trump wasn t lying at all, Fahrenthold decided to hold Trump s feet to the fire. After Trump repeatedly dodged questions about his donations to charity, Fahrenthold compiled an exhaustive list of charities Trump was said to have given money to and painstakingly eliminated each one. In the end, the reporting showed that Trump was perhaps one of the least charitable rich people in the country. He also ran down individual anecdotes exposing Trump has a showboating opportunist who cynically exploited charity events for PR but avoided giving any money.In one example discovered by Fahrenthold, Trump stagecrashed an event meant to honor donors, stole the seat of a legitimate donor and then left before anyone knew what had just happened. Nobody knew he was coming,  said Abigail Disney, another donor sitting on the dais.  There s this kind of ruckus at the door, and I don t know what was going on, and in comes Donald Trump. [He] just gets up on the podium and sits down. Trump was not a major donor. He was not a donor, period. He d never given a dollar to the nursery or the Association to Benefit Children, according to Gretchen Buchenholz, the charity s executive director then and now.It is for exposing stories like this and others that Fahrenthold has become reviled in the Trump White House and in conservative circles. He does what fearless journalism has always done: Speak truth to power.Hilariously, Farhrenthold isn t the only person to win the prestigious award for his coverage of Trump. Miami Herald cartoonist Jim Morin earned a Pulitzer for equally biting criticism of Trump.

The paper exposed the rampant corruption and cruelty of the Putin regime in Russia. This made things extremely awkward for Trump. He, of course, benefited greatly from Putin s willingness to undermine democracy   specifically America s 2016 election. Trump has also praised the autocrat as a strong leader and at one time claimed him as a friend.It s extremely telling that so many of the top honors went to people who either directly or indirectly stood up to Trump s administration   whether it be clear-eyed reporting on the corruption from within the White House or the disastrous effects of the policies they and their allies in Congress have forced upon the country. In dark days, fearless critical reporting is more valuable than ever. And with Trump already threatening to crank up censorship laws, it s a rare and powerful commodity.Featured image via Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images",0

Virtual worlds and reality, as humanity has known it to be for millennia, appear to be on ever-converging paths.  Will humanity and digital reality be on a path of integration or a collision course?While the direct application of Virtual Reality was difficult to see in everyday life following the 1992 Hollywood film Lawnmower Man, the reality of such technology is now coming into focus.Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality technology (also interchangeably known as either AR/VR or VR/AR) are ideas that have been hammered out in the digital sphere with regards to concepts and applications of use. Along with the steady advancement of digital computing power, an AR/VR future might better be portrayed in certain episodes of Black Mirror, such as Fifteen Million Merits or Playtest. Black Mirror s, Playtest: Season 4, Episode 2. A stare-down between perception and reality (Image Source: Polygon)The possibility and potential of the technology has made it a magnet for investment. There are profits to be made in this growing realm, and the implications of what these emerging technologies could do for (and to) humanity is staggering.So before delving into some current developments in AR/VR technology, let s take a quick look at historically new technologies which are now a part of our real world, everyday, lives: the smartphone and the motor vehicle.The Smartphone StratosphereOn one hand, the smart phone is merely synthetic material with  touch  screens and circuitry. Now in less than two decades, there are those whose daily lives are hindered without one. The attachment is almost as emotional as it is literal in some instances. Many need them to communicate, be entertained, figure out where they are, purchase products, or even socially interact with others or the avatars of others. To many teenagers across the world and Generation Y Millennials, the smartphone has always been there.It can be argued that society as a whole is becoming dependent and addicted to smartphones and other  smart  devices. In fact, with over 2.5 billion smartphone subscriptions world wide in 2016, corporations and marketers are counting on it.Seeing a person interacting with any number of touch-screen devices does not garner much of a second look. Oftentimes, the person without the smart phone is the person who stands out in a crowd, as they are sometimes seen reading one of those archaic things we call a  book.  It is now commonplace that people can interact with thousands of different applications on countless versions of technological devices.Hooked: Not only can we take the physical work out of travel on mass-transit, we can also be oblivious to the journey along the way, as well as the work involved to make it all happen.  (Image Source: ne-asia.com)After a few generations, many technologies simply become integrated  as it were. They become a part of us and our day-to-day lives, and are a part of the real world.For comparative analysis, let s take a look at the evolution of another well-known technology, the motor vehicle From Engines to ElectricIn roughly 100 years, humanity has essentially integrated itself with motorized vehicle technology. The motor vehicle and all the industries that come with it, has shaped the world as we know it.Driving a vehicle, and everything that comes with it such as such as its design, manufacture, delivery, sale, gas and oil production, road ways, traffic laws, law enforcement, theft, accidents, smog, fighting over oil resources, etc., has effected nearly everyone.The sales pitch and appeal of the motor vehicle have always gone together. From its early days, to current-day advertisements, automobiles have been marketed with the promise of freedom on the open road. In fact, the evolution of vehicular technology is a good indicator of how a specific type of technology can transform humanity in a very short amount of time. Technological Bliss: A promise of open roads and freedom (Image Source: NBC.com)The promise of anything good always seems to have a catch. Ease of movement with the automobile is not without its environmental impact. Without the automobile in particular, we would not have terms such as gridlock, traffic jam, or road rage for instance.Progress is not without its side effects.  (Image Source: kerma.wordpress.com)The motor vehicle is a technology and a part of our world to such an extent that where we are dependent on it.The environmental and health concerns of gas and oil extraction and production, as well as geopolitical maneuvering and even warfare based on assumed resource scarcity, the deep infrastructure roots and dependence of commerce is in place. To stop the flow of motor vehicles, would inhibit the freedom of people to travel, commute to work, and utterly stop industry and commerce in its place.Electrically Re-energizing the AutomobileThe current slow-but-eventual transition from gasoline engines to hybrid or fully electric ones is just an evolution of the technology. While electric car technology is believed to have been discovered in the mid-1800 s, it has only recently made inroads to the industry on a potentially large scale with the Roadster by Tesla Motors.The Tesla Model S, has a 2017 manufacturer s suggested retail price (MSRP) of $69,200 dollars, while the most recent (2015)  US Real Median Family Income  was listed as $69,929.With the success of Tesla, the amount of established gas and oil engine automakers is lining up to diversify their portfolio for their consumers, is  who s who  list of the auto-industry. BMW, Chrysler-Fiat, Daimler (Mercedes),  Ford, General Motors, Honda, KIA, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Volkswagen, and Volvo, all have their own hybrid or electric car lines. After decades of profit, these industry giants can t wait to show the consumer that they too are environmentally conscious. Likewise, the consumer appears ready to accept  guilt free  and environmentally responsible driving as the electric car continues to improve, lowers in price, and becomes more widely available.Emerging Patterns: AR/VR technologyWith many integrated technologies in our lives such as smart devices or motor vehicles, if it feels like  we ve seen this pattern before,  it is because we have.First the technology is new. Next commercialism, industry, education systems, entertainment, pop culture, and the government, all conspire to get in on the action; during this time, the race to integrate and capitalize on a technology in the name progress can induce a Gold Rush type of feeding frenzy. Then pre-established corporations are already pre-positioned, with the ready capital, assets, and resources to pounce on  the next big thing.  And finally, over a generation or so of different improvements and variations, it is hard to remember a world without said technology for those who inherit a world with it. Whether real or imagined   it becomes a necessity.The likely integration of Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality (AR/VR) into our daily lives will likely follow the same pattern as other technological advances. Similarly, with regards to forecasting its future integration in our lives, the saying  follow the money  applies.First though, what exactly is AR/VR as it is currently understood to be?Augmented Reality (AR) uses the world around you, but a device introduces virtual items, characters, etc., into the real world that a person interacts with. This is popularly seen with the downloadable application for smart phones, with the game Pok mon GO.Virtual Reality (VR) is the glasses/headset set-up where you are visually, and often audibly, immersed. Put on the glasses/headset, or similar gear such as Oculus Rift, or VIVE and you are in a whole virtual world.Both technologies are primed for upward momentum.Although economic forecasting has not always been an exact science, the monetary forecast for AR/VR technology seems to point upward.Business Wire notes: worldwide revenues for the augmented reality and virtual reality (AR/VR) market to reach $13.9 billion in 2017, an increase of 130.5% over the $6.1 billion spent in 2016.  AR/VR spending is expected to accelerate over the next several years, achieving a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 198.0% over the 2015-2020 forecast period and totaling $143.3 billion in 2020. It is important to note that the above figures are amounts projected to be spent by companies to further advance AR/VR technology. So the expectation for profit is most likely in the trillions.Does this sound far-fetched? For a  real world success story with regards to these emerging technologies in terms of profit, then Pok mon GO has been there, done that, and cashed the checks.By some estimates, Pok mon GO has made Niantic over 900 million dollars in 2016.Using Pok mon GO as a barometer of future profits, the potential is huge. Especially when you consider that in the ever-changing gaming world, many already considered outdated, requiring updates, fixes, and new features by many of it s users.  If Pok mon GO calls it a career or not, the fortune has already been made.Virtual scavenger hunts are fun!That kind of money has already inspired a similar styled  brand-supported  game in its early stages, called Snatch. Besides the puzzle and scavenger hunt aspects of Snatch, players will be immersed into an augmented reality with a commercialized, brand name, token-based, application where you can  snatch  items from other players to win prizes.If you do not fully  get it  perhaps the below video can help explain what it s all about.You heard it hear first; if it hasn t happened already, playing Snatch is likely to start at least one physical, real world, fight over the potential of having a prize  snatched  by a player nearby.Immersion, Entertainment & InvestmentAll of the AR/VR technology is still  finding its sea-legs so to speak and is still in transition with more  immersive  worlds. Along the way, AR/VR has been undergoing a natural progression and fusion with the gaming world. Gaming, and entertainment, appears to be the seductive gateway application for AR/VR technology development and profit potential.As games and game consoles have become more immersive over the years, it appears that AR/VR is expected to advance with it.The addictive element to immersive games is often literal in some cases as seen in the WebMD.com article Video Game Addiction No Fun:  The lure of a fantasy world is especially pertinent to online role-playing games. These are games in which a player assumes the role of a fictional character and interacts with other players in a virtual world   [according to Kimberly Young, PsyD] an intelligent child who is unpopular at school can  become dominant in the game.  The virtual life becomes more appealing than real life. Also, let there be little doubt that any psychological aspect of marketing to churn out profit will be used, as the video-gaming world is a 100 billion dollar industry globally. That s hardly child s play.The greater the entertainment immersion and the technological bliss, the bigger  the hook  to the consuming public will become. So despite a slow-yet-increasing public acclimatization with regards to AR/VR, investments keep pouring in.According to Digi-Capital, the investments for AR/VR start-ups in 2016 came in at a cool $2.3 billion dollars.These numbers for start-ups are in addition to previous acquisitions such as Facebooks  Mark Zuckerberg s now famous $2 billion dollar purchase of Oculus Rift.Investments also include such companies as NextVR that can deliver live events in a VR format.  The investors are a  who s who  of present day media empires in the United States.We see the following from nanalyze.com: Laguna Beach California startup NextVR has taken in $115 million in funding so far from investors that include Time Warner, Comcast, and The Madison Square Garden Company. In addition to these strategic investors, FOX Sports, Live Nation, NBC Sports, HBO/Golden Boy, Turner Sports, and CNN have all partnered with NextVR .The object for up-and-running companies like Next VR, or their investor Live Nation, is to bring entertainment events such as concerts or sporting events to the masses.In addition to the actual gate at a sporting event or concert of say, 50,000 people, you could also charge a virtual gate, if you will, for another million people who were never even there.Another company starting to make some real world profits is Utah s THE VOID.  The company is in continually advancing their Dream Park in Utah.  They have themed virtual reality (or hyper reality as they refer to it) type of  experiences  in New York and Dubai.Below is a trailer for their Ghostbusters hyper-reality experience in New York City.That s right   you too can don a nuclear power pack and save New York from the giant Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.To be fair, besides entertainment purposes, there will be benefits of AR/VR technology. Uses for design, training, and experimentation within a multitude of industries, science, and research and development, can all be enabled by VR. Medical students can practice on  fake  patients, soldiers can train in virtual combat with no casualties, researchers can get inside of a molecule, designers or architects can better visualize or display their concepts, and so on.For example, in April 2016, the United Kingdom s Medical Realities used its product The Virtual Surgeon, which is a  learning program   developed for head mounted displays such as the Oculus Rift and Samsung Gear VR . The live-stream was a first of its kind showing a live surgery allowing for a 360 degree view, and was witnessed live in places as far as China and Tunisia according to their site.Virtual Medicine (Image Source: Medical Realities)The other side of the AR/VR coinKeep in mind, however, that there this is likely a trade off for well-intentioned purposes realized by the implementation and advancement of AR/VR. These same advancements in AR/VR will also almost undoubtedly have profit, control, surveillance, and culture-shaping, as drivers for its very implementation and integration to our lives.AR/VR, like art, books, pamphlets, magazines, newspapers, graffiti, radio, television, and the internet, is a medium which can be utilized. With social norms, economies, and forms of government to influence the masses thrown into as variables, the acclimatization to AR/VR by society is likely to be many things to many people.  Even today, we have News and Fake News. President; not my President. Facts and Alternate Facts.  All of these types of psychological shaping of reality could be further jammed into Virtual Reality.Even within education. Subjective topics, or viewpoints on historical events made to be realistic for experiential learning purposes could be abused. No different then a book or website, a VR lesson will have an author, a bias, and will be an area rife with the potential for politicization or propaganda infusion.Like motor vehicles or smart devices above, AR/VR also has society-changing potential. The possibilities for mass-level use, consumption, and integration of virtual technology could very well change our reality; literally and figuratively; shared and personal. The implications go beyond the industry and commercial implications of its use and delve into what makes us human and into what is real.We hear it all the time, but social engineering is what it sounds like.  The direct implication of the phrase is that aspects of society can be engineered and designed towards a desired effect or result.The outcome desired for those at the top of our current power structures and institutions might entail use of technology to socially engineer with a nefarious slant: to conform the masses, infuse propaganda, create thoughtless compliance, and degrade critical thinking in favor of living a blissful other life, elsewhere in another digital reality.As the great celluloid philosopher, Morpheus, from the Hollywood blockbuster The Matrix, once pondered,  What is real?  How do you define  real ?  If you re talking about what you can feel, what you can smell, what you can taste and see  then  real  is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain. Might the world literally become whatever anyone wants to make of it?Are we choosing for ourselves, or are we all merely like  fish in the ocean  being swept up unawares in a tide of social engineering?A technologically controlled, artificial, designed, and immersive environment could possibly redefine reality, and what it means to be human along with it.READ MORE ABOUT TECHNOLOGY: 21st Century Wire Technology Files ",0
344,"Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook is becoming a large public figure to the world, and not just for creating the world famous social media website we ve all come to know so well.Mark first launched Facebook in February of 2004 with his college roommates at Harvard University. The group then introduced Facebook to other campuses. Facebook rapidly gained popularity, with just over a billion users by 2012. As Facebook grew, so did Zuckerberg s net worth, which is now just over $50 billion USD. However, Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan, vowed to donate 99% of that wealth to charity.Since 2009, Forbes Magazine has created an annual list of the top 10 world s most powerful people, and in December of 2016 Mark Zuckerberg made that list. Although Mark is at the bottom of the list, he is much younger than anyone else on the list. However, Mark s influence doesn t stop there. Recently, Mark Zuckerberg has launched a mission to give the entire world internet.Yet, what s the point of all this? Does Mr. Zuckerberg just have a strong urge to make his mark, which is already a big one, or does he have a bigger plan? In the last summer Facebook was accused by a group of conservatives of being liberally biased. In response Mark met with some conservatives to ease their troubled minds. Mark has never publicly taken a side in politics, but he s involved in a handful of organizations that terrify republicans.On January 3rd, Mark posted about some of his goals for the new year:Going into this challenge, it seems we are at a turning point in history. For decades, technology and globalization have made us more productive and connected. This has created many benefits, but for a lot of people it has also made life more challenging. This has contributed to a greater sense of division than I have felt in my lifetime. We need to find a way to change the game so it works for everyone.My work is about connecting the world and giving everyone a voice. I want to personally hear more of those voices this year. It will help me lead the work at Facebook and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative so we can make the most positive impact as the world enters an important new period.We are indeed at a turning point in history, and it s very intriguing to see what role Mark will play in it, maybe he will undo some of president-elect Donald Trump s damages come 2020. If Donald Trump can rally up enough support to get elected, Mark Zuckerberg can easily do the same.Featured image via David Ramos/Getty Images",0
592,"Trump s weekend trips to Mar-a-Lago and his nearby golf course have repeatedly been met with crowds of protesters. Just yesterday, protesters surprised Trump by showing up on his route to his golf course despite the fact that he had tried to keep the trip a secret. How d they know? Unfortunately for Trump, protesters correctly guessed that just 48 hours after he kickstarted a war in Syria he would probably be back on his golf course.Pool: Motorcade passed ""group of about a dozen protesters w/ signs reading ""Resign,"" ""Loser,"" and ""Impeach Trump"" outside the golf course.""  Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) April 8, 2017Trump clearly doesn t enjoy seeing reminders that his presidency is highly unpopular. This appears to be Trump s solution:The newest addition to Mar a Lago  a helipad and Trump chopper. pic.twitter.com/Hxb8QyR8Uu  Vivian Salama (@vmsalama) April 9, 2017Trump s administration claims the helipad was built to carry Trump from the airport to his resort without interrupting traffic. They also conceded that traffic will likely still be blocked off or otherwise disrupted near the resort each time he is in town   roughly once a week. And like everything Trump does, the helipad comes at the expense of the average people unlucky enough to live nearby Trump s resort.When the proposal was first drawn up, it faced criticism for its disruptions to the lives of those around the area:Jesse H. Diner, a Fort Lauderdale attorney representing Woodbridge Avenue resident Nancy deMoss, urged commissioners to hold off on approving the project until they consider alternatives to the location. These are big helicopters, they re like flying tanks,  Diner said.DeMoss requires around-the-clock health care that has been impacted by Trump s weekend visits. Diner said she and her family is worried that the loud helicopters will be a nuisance, and she is uncomfortable with the U.S. Coast Guard boats sporting guns when Trump is in town.Trump went ahead with the plan anyway.Adding more absurdity, Trump s personal helicopter appears to be using the helipad this weekend. The official Marine One, nor Trump, have used the helipad so far, but a giant helicopter with Trump s name printed in red across the tail sat in its spot. Trump s staff said it would be  staged  there until Sunday   a shameless photo op attempt.It s also not clear whether Trump or taxpayers are paying for the helipad used exclusively to indulge Trump s golf obsession. The helipad was registered by the National Trust for Historic Preservation suggesting Trump wants to treat his helipad as a site of national significance as if it s Mount Rushmore and not an excuse for Trump to take more vacations.If the cost of the helipad indeed comes out of the pockets of taxpayers it will be a stiff addition to the already $23 million Trump has spent taking vacations while president for just 11 weeks. At this rate, Trump is projected to eclipse Obama s entire cost of travel in just 10 months.It s for this reason that Trump appears desperate to rebrand his opulent resort as the  Southern White House  in order to deflect criticisms that he s too often partying there instead of doing the job of president. It would be unsurprising to find that someday Trump renames the 18th hole at his Florida golf course after the Oval Office.Featured image via Twitter",0

271,"One day after he testified about being stopped by immigration officials under Donald Trump s Muslim ban, the son of boxing legend Muhammad Ali was detained by immigration officials again   this time on a domestic flight.Muhammad Ali Jr. traveled to Washington on Wednesday to testify about the first time he was detained on his way back from a Black History Month speech he gave with his mother in Jamaica. Ali Jr. was initially detained at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport on February 7 and questioned for two hours, with officials grilling him with ever-important questions like  Are you a Muslim  and  where did you get your name.  This time, the boxer s son didn t even make it to Florida.While attempting to board a flight home in a Washington-area airport, the TSA immediately took issue with his identification:When Mr. Ali, whose father died last year, arrived at Reagan National Airport in Washington on Friday for a flight to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., he gave his Illinois identification card to a JetBlue agent to get his boarding pass, said his lawyer, Chris Mancini, who was traveling with him and witnessed the episode. Almost immediately, Mr. Ali was told that there was a problem and that the agent needed to call the Department of Homeland Security, Mr. Mancini said.Mr. Ali, 44, was asked his date of birth, where he was born and his Social Security number, Mr. Mancini said. After answering the questions, he was told that his Illinois-issued identification card, which expires in 2019 but is not a driver s license, was invalid for flying. The same state ID from Illinois that he traveled to Washington on was rejected,  Mr. Mancini said in an interview on Friday night. Mr. Ali then produced his United States passport, which was accepted, and went through security and boarded the flight with his mother, Khalilah Camacho-Ali, the second wife of Muhammad Ali, and Mr. Mancini.Mr. Mancini said that the episode lasted between 20 and 25 minutes.  This whole thing smacks of some sort of retaliation for his testimony,  he said.The TSA, as is typical, absolved itself of all wrongdoing . Upon arriving at the airline check-in counter, a call was made to confirm Mr. Ali s identity with T.S.A. officials,  the agency says.  When Mr. Ali arrived at the checkpoint, his large jewelry alarmed the checkpoint scanner. He received a targeted pat-down in the area of his jewelry to clear the alarm and was cleared to catch his flight. This is now the second time over the course of two separate Muslim bans in which a well-known figure was singled out seemingly for no better reason than his name. This does not keep America safe   it makes everyday Americans afraid to travel if their skin is too dark or if they might appear too  Muslimy  to the unwashed bigots who regularly staff TSA checkpoints across the nation.If this is what America looks like when it s  Great Again,  then maybe we should stop. Let s not be so great. Our country can t handle it.Featured image via Getty Images (Mandel Ngan)",0

134,"Donald Trump has been wasting taxpayer dollars on his personal vacations, protection for his giant golden tower in New York, security at his golf clubs, and pretty much everything else you can imagine ever since he assumed office, but if you needed an example of how bad things are we can t even afford to pay the Secret Service agents protecting him anymore.CNBC reports that more than 1,000 agents have  already hit the federally mandated caps for salary and overtime allowances that were meant to last the entire year  thanks to the  crushing workload  Donald Trump has brought them.The Secret Service has a big job with the Trump family. Not only do they have to protect him as he jaunts from golf course to golf course, but they are also forced to protect his sniveling children on their business trips both in the United States and abroad. The president has a large family, and our responsibility is required in law,  Secret Service Director Randolph  Tex  Alles said in an interview.  I can t change that. I have no flexibility. The Trump family is such a big problem that Alles says that without more funding, he won t even be able to pay agents for work they have already done:The compensation crunch is so serious that the director has begun discussions with key lawmakers to raise the combined salary and overtime cap for agents, from $160,000 per year to $187,000 for at least the duration of Trump s first term.But even if such a proposal was approved, about 130 veteran agents would not be fully compensated for hundreds of hours already amassed, according to the agency. I don t see this changing in the near term,  Alles said.As the Trump family continues to bleed the country dry with their constant vacations and business trips   all of which require Secret Service protection   Congress is actually considering giving them more money to flush down the toilet as they are forced to pay for hotel rooms, travel, and even $60,000 (and growing) in golf cart rentals.The solution isn t to give the Trump family more money. It s time for Congress to take action to limit travel or pass legislation that would exempt personal vacations and business trips for the President s children from requiring Secret Service protection once the agency s budget has been exhausted.It s time for the Trump family to begin living within the country s means.Featured image via Getty Images/Alex wong",0
223,"Every American needs to consider this new evidence about Hillary and how her campaign is helping to hide her poor health from voters unless of course, the only reason you re planning to vote for Hillary is because you like her VP candidate, Tim Kaine Why does Hillary reject a bottle of water for a glass of water during her coughing fit in front of press on her new campaign plane? Why does Hillary have a stool and GLASS OF WATER next to her at all times during public appearances? Why does Hillary tell press she s suffering from allergies when allergens aren t even high in the specific region where she s speaking? Why is Hillary resting while Donald Trump is out running circles around her on the campaign trail? Why does the media cover for her lies and MOST IMPORTANTLY, why is anyone supporting this woman who is clearly not well enough to even campaign for the highest office in our nation???During the Republican National Convention last June, two Secret Service agents approached InfoWars and asked to speak to them about Hillary s health. The Secret Service contacted me. They said that Hillary Clinton has Parkinson s disease. They [Hillary s people] spent over a quarter million dollars on these stairs to allow her to step down from the vehicle to the ground because she has trouble walking. They [Secret Service] said that any kind of flashes or strobes will set her off into a seizure, and that s why they wanted to come us.They wanted to contact us and give us information because they knew we [InforWars] would be able to get this out. [Unlike the MSM,] we wouldn t be scared to do it. And you know it really makes a lot of sense when you watch all these videos. The fact that she s refusing to do these news conferences. Hillary had not done a press conference for 8  months. Her last press conference was on December 4, 2015.DOES HILLARY HAVE PARKINSON S DISEASE?As a neurological disorder, Parkinson s disease (PD) has been shown to affect motor skills in the limbs, inhibit muscle coordination, and sometimes contribute to dysphagia.1   Dysphagia is the medical term for difficulty swallowing. Thickened liquids are often used in the management of dysphagia to improve bolus control and to help prevent aspiration. A range of starches and gums has historically been used to thicken liquids. Although thickened liquids improve swallow safety, they appear to have a great potential for unintended physiological consequences.Like this  unintended physiological consequence  maybe?  Why does Hillary always have a stool and GLASS OF WATER at every public appearance? Don t most people in this day and age drink from a bottle of water?Again the stool and the GLASS OF WATER And again On Feb. 4, WND reported Hillary Clinton has been prescribed Armour Thyroid, a natural medication made from desiccated pig thyroid glands, for her hypothyroid condition and Coumadin   a brand name of warfarin, which initially was developed as a well-known rat poison   for her congenital tendency to form blood clots.WND also reported the medication Clinton has taken since 1998 to deal with her blood-clotting problems may have side effects that are hazardous to her health, including blurred vision and confusion, both of which she has experienced. And a California physician warned Coumadin could be more life-threatening to her than the possibility of a recurring blood clot.Bill Clinton, during a question and answer session at the Peterson Foundation in Washington, on May 14, 2014, told the audience that the concussion Hillary suffered  required six months of very serious work to get over. On Nov. 16, 2015, in an exchange between Hillary Clinton s aides Huma Abedin and Monica Hanley dated Jan. 26, 2013, regarding Clinton s schedule, the aides said it was  very important  to go over phone calls with Clinton because the former secretary of state was  often confused. Clinton s five-minute bathroom break at the third Democratic debate in Goffstown, New Hampshire, on Dec. 19, 2015, initially attributed to the distance of the woman s bathroom from the stage, was reported to have caused a  flare up of problems from brain injury  that required Clinton to sit in a chair off-stage to recover from fatigue, dizziness and disorientation.WND just last week reported that at least 10 prominent physicians have been questioning Hillary Clinton s health.Based on publicly available information, the following physicians have raised concerns:  Dr. Jane Orient, M.D., executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, said images of Clinton being helped up stairs and propped up, and videos showing odd, seizure-like head movements require an explanation to voters, she contends. The author of  Emerging Diseases: Protecting Your Family from Pandemics, Viral Threats, and Rogue Vaccines  noted the  vituperation and anger  that she s faced for raising questions.  I m not making a diagnosis,  she told WND on Monday. But  I can look at the video. You can look. She said for a medical professional to simply ignore the evidence would be  completely reckless.  Meeting someone with these symptoms personally would require a  How are you?  she said.  These are not ridiculous questions.  Dr. Lee Hieb, author of  Surviving the Medical Meltdown: Your Guide to Living Through the Disaster of Obamacare,  agreed.  They made a huge deal about [Sen. John] McCain because of his melanoma,  she told WND.  Melanoma doesn t give you dementia!  She said the images and videos are evidence that should be reviewed and explained to voters, contending Clinton is  not being forthcoming. If she doesn t want the American people informed   we know where she stands. Citing Clinton s previous concussion, Hieb said such injuries can cause long-term side effects, seizures, personality changes and cognitive deficits.  The Fox News medical  A-Team  of Dr. Marc Siegel and Dr. David Samadi had questions.  In 2008   I looked over a thousand pages of John McCain s records because of a melanoma he had 10 years ago. What about Hillary? In 2009, a severe fall. She breaks her elbow. In 2011, she boards a plane, falls. In 2012, she has a severe concussion which Bill Clinton says took her six months to recover from,  Siegel said. He continued:  Then she ends up with a blood clot in the brain and a lifetime of blood thinners. Just that point alone   if she s prone to falling, you can see from that picture up there that it looked like she can barely get upstairs without two people carrying her. Guess what if she falls and hits her head? She ll get a blood clot.  Dr. Drew Pinsky s television show on the HLN cable network,  Dr. Drew on Call,  was canceled after he raised questions about Clinton s health in an interview on KABC-AM in Los Angeles. Alt-Right fanatics and conspiracy theorists  immediately questioned her health   is she ok? And concerns over Hillary s  worst coughing fit ever  was raised by MSNBC.But as Paul Josepth Watson reports, MSNBC regurgitated claims by Hillary s campaign aides that,  Allergens were high in Northeast Ohio on Monday,  before asserting that there is  no evidence to indicate she is unwell. Whore press already running defense for #HackingHillary, blaming pollen. What about the 10 previous times? pic.twitter.com/lwDNYjhEhI  Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) September 5, 2016The problem for that propadandist line is   It was a complete fabrication.As numerous websites that track daily allergen levels confirmed, grass pollen was low, tree pollen was low and ragweed pollen was moderate.

560,"As if Trump calling for a private organization to fire people who refuse to stand for the national anthem wasn t bad enough, it now seems that some high schools have decided to follow his dangerous lead. Parkway High School, in Bossier, Louisiana, will start punishing football players who won t stand for the national anthem. They could face less playing time or getting kicked off the team entirely.Waylon Bates, Parkway s principal, says that they  require students to stand in a respectful manner throughout the National Anthem during any sporting event in which their team is participating. Failure to comply will result in loss of playing time and/or participation as directed by the head coach and principal. Continued failure to comply will result in removal from the team. Parkway High School is committed to creating a positive environment for sporting events that is free of disruption to the athletic contest or game. And it has begun.High schools are now following Trump s order.Will kick off any players who don t stand during the National Anthem. pic.twitter.com/lfNWyW7z5f  Shaun King (@ShaunKing) September 28, 2017CBS News says that Bates is trying to keep politics out of his schools athletics. He accomplished the exact opposite with this letter, though. In fact, there s a chance now that this will only spur black athletes and their allies to do exactly what Bates does not want them doing.Evidently, the Louisiana High School Athletic Association allows schools to set their own rules about this kind of thing, so other high schools may or may not follow suit here. But the school doesn t seem to care about anything except forcing students to worship the flag. This is one of the replies to Shaun King s tweet:Called them- said constitution doesn t apply to extracurricular activities. Seriously- they said that.  td_port (@td_port) September 28, 2017Too bad for the school that case law seems to be on the side of any students who wish protest, well, anything by not standing for the national anthem. Almost 75 years ago, in the midst of WWII, the Supreme Court delivered a 6-3 decision stating that public school systems cannot require students to salute the flag in West Virginia State Board of Education et al v. Barnette et al. This decision reversed an earlier SCOTUS decision upholding the ability of schools and districts to do that exact thing.This case is generally seen in the context that requiring students to salute the flag can be a violation of religious principles since the plaintiffs were Jehovah s Witnesses. Their religion prohibits them from saluting symbols. The majority opinion, however, barely even mentions religious freedom. Justice Jackson, writing for the majority in West Virginia Board of Ed v. Barnette, tied this to other freedoms protected in the Bill of Rights, rather than making it about religious expression. He held that  freedoms of speech and of press, of assembly, and of worship may not be infringed [on] slender grounds,  and wrote: Censorship or suppression of expression of opinion is tolerated by our Constitution only when the expression presents a clear and present danger of action of a kind the State is empowered to prevent and publish. It would seem that involuntary affirmation could be commanded only on even more immediate and urgent grounds than silence. In this case, Jackson believed that silence didn t  create a clear and present danger that would justify an effort even to muffle expression,  and said: To sustain the compulsory flag salute we are required to say that a Bill of Rights which guards the individual s right to speak his own mind left it open to public authorities to compel him to utter what is not in his mind. Justice Jackson essentially turned the case into one where the government tries to establish its own religion and tries to force its own views onto people; in that case, children. And it could be seen this way in Parkway s case, too, since standing for the national anthem can be considered saluting the flag. The school has delivered an ultimatum to its student athletes: Stand during the national anthem or else.Trump set off a firestorm by calling for NFL owners to fire players who sit or kneel (or stay in the locker room) during the national anthem. Despite the backlash, he s doubled down, and tripled down, and quadrupled down on it, spending a lot of time on Twitter slamming the NFL and completely ignoring the reasons behind the protests (to say nothing of his continued slights to Puerto Rico, which is now in the midst of a humanitarian crisis thanks to back-to-back powerful hurricanes).And now, high schools are starting to weigh in, and it may well be illegal for them to do so. Despite sports being extra-curricular, this is still a school official forcing his students to worship a symbol. And Parkway High School s principal has dragged politics into his athletic program with an ill-advised letter violating the First Amendment rights of students.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",0

1128,"Caleb Keeter, a lifelong proponent of the Second Amendment, and guitarist for Texas country outfit the Josh Abbott Band has had a strong change of heart regarding gun control. What changed his stance was  the events of last night  in which a gunman opened fire killing 58 people and injuring 515 others, marking it as the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. While  thoughts and prayers  are offered by the masses after each deadly shooting, Keeter took it a step further, posting a lengthy message on Twitter to express his personal thoughts after the attack.Keeter, who survived the attack, wrote,  I ve been a proponent of the 2nd amendment my entire life. Until the events of last night.   I cannot express how wrong I was. We actually have members of our crew with [Concealed Handgun Licenses], and legal firearms on the bus,  Keeter continued.  They were useless. We couldn t touch them for fear police might think we were part of the massacre and shoot us. A small group (or one man) laid waste to a city with dedicated, fearless police officers desperately trying to help, because of access to an insane amount of fire power.Enough is enough.Writing my parents and the love of my life a goodbye last night and a living will because I felt like I wasn t going to live through the night was enough for me to realize that this is completely and totally out of hand. These rounds were just powerful enough that my crew guys just standing in close proximity of a victim shot by this f ing coward received shrapnel wounds.We need gun control RIGHT. NOW. My biggest regret is that I stubbornly didn t realize it until my brothers on the road and myself were threatened by it. We are unbelievably fortunate to not be among the number of victims killed or seriously wounded by this maniac.pic.twitter.com/0NFjHf3PW2  Caleb Keeter (@Calebkeeter) October 2, 2017Some Twitter users wondered about his change of heart. Why now instead of when a gunman opened fire in 2012, slaughtering twenty first-graders and six adults at the Sandy Hook elementary school.On Twitter user wrote,  It s frustrating that some don t call the fire dept until the blaze is at their own front door. But we need more ppl on our side. Welcome. Caleb admitted that he s done nothing about gun violence which has rocked our country for years, but said he would like to do something now. You are all absolutely correct,  he tweeted.  I saw this happening for years and did nothing. But I d like to do what I can now. You are all absolutely correct.

We will regroup, we ll come back, and we ll rock your fu*king faces off. Bet on it. It s OK to be for the Second Amendment and for gun control.

479,"For the first time since taking office, Donald Trump will be reunited with Vladimir Putin and he s very excited about it. His advisors, however, are not. They are shaking in their boots at the idea that Trump will go overboard in exuberance and potentially implicate himself, and presumably some of them, in collusion.While Trump is cutting off media access in many areas, including with a camera and audio blackout at press briefings, for the meeting with Putin, he wants the media to see it all. His advisors are pushing for something much more low-key and even for something that doesn t involve Trump at all.Trump and some others within his administration have been pressing for a full bilateral meeting. He s calling for media access and all the typical protocol associated with such sessions, even as officials within the State Department and National Security Council urge more restraint, according to a current and a former administration official.Some advisers have recommended that the president instead do either a quick, informal  pull-aside  on the sidelines of the summit, or that the U.S. and Russian delegations hold  strategic stability talks,  which typically don t involve the presidents. The officials spoke anonymously to discuss private policy discussions.Source: Associated PressTrump s goal for the meeting is particularly troubling. He wants to roll back all the Obama-era sanctions on Russia and would like to partner with them in Syria, despite the fact that Russia is on the wrong side of a rebellion against Bashar al-Assad s brutal, dictatorial regime. Assad, as you may recall, used chemical weapons against his own people.Those optics aren t what Trump s advisors are afraid of, though. They are afraid that Trump will be, well Trump. A man who has no verbal filter.There are big risks, though. Trump is known to veer off-script, creating the possibility for a high-stakes diplomatic blunder. In a brief Oval Office meeting with top Russian diplomats last month, Trump revealed highly classified information about an Islamic State group threat to airlines that was relayed to him by Israel, according to a senior administration official. The White House defended the disclosures as  wholly appropriate. In other words, it s entirely within the realm of possibility that Trump will hug Putin and thank him, in front of cameras, for all his help during the election. Remember when Trump met with the Russian ambassador and spy chief in the White House? It was about the happiest we ve ever seen him.Hard facts: last April Trump promised Russia s ambassador a  good deal.  Hacking began. Kislyak asked for an end to sanctions. Trump: *yes*. pic.twitter.com/67dzaKpLeX  Seth Abramson (@SethAbramson) June 19, 2017It s pretty clear that Trump can t contain his giddiness over his country crush. That s bad enough.

844,"Former President George W. Bush gave a speech on Thursday in which he said that  bigotry seems emboldened  in the U.S. and warned that Americans need to reject  white supremacy.  This is the speech that Trump should have given even before the Nazi march in Charlottesville. Donald Trump was backed by every white supremacist group across the board during his divisive campaign. Although Bush pointed to the  governing class,  he did not mention the former reality show star s name, but it was obvious that he was talking about Trump, his policies, and his base.Bush spoke of our  discourse being degraded by casual cruelty.  He continued to say that we ve seen nationalism distorted into nativism  and added that  we need to recover and recall our own identity. Discontent deepened and sharpened partisan conflicts  in recent years, Bush said in remarks from New York City at a forum focused on security and sponsored by the George W. Bush Institute. Bigotry seems emboldened. Our politics seem more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication,  the former President continued.Bush also warned against  a new era of cyber threats  including Russia s attempt to influence the 2016 presidential election, a thing which Donald Trump has called a hoax. Ultimately this assault won t succeed, but foreign aggressions including cyber attacks, disinformation, and financial influence should never be downplayed or tolerated,  he said. Bigotry or white supremacy in any form is blasphemy against the American creed,  Bush continued.The Hill reports:Bush, who advocates free trade, promoted multilateral and bilateral trade deals during his presidency. Trump is now demanding that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and Mexico be renegotiated, under the threat of a U.S. withdrawal. We cannot wish globalization away,  Bush said, then he went on to urge society to  adapt  to economic and social change.Bush went on to warn that democracies face  new and serious threats  today.Economic, political and national security challenges  proliferate,  he said. And they re made worse by the tendency to turn inward,  he said.  The health of the Democratic spirit itself is at issue and the renewal of that spirit is the urgent task at hand. Our governing class has often been paralyzed in the face of obvious and pressing needs. The American dream of upward mobility seems out of reach for some who feel left behind in a changing economy,  he added.Watch:President George W Bush in NYC:  We ve seen nationalism distorted into nativism we need to recall and recover our own identity  pic.twitter.com/dsiSkFzEVp  Pat Ward (@WardDPatrick) October 19, 2017While Bush wasn t a great president, he wasn t an evil man (his vice-president was a doozy, though).

1028,"Trump, like George W. Bush before him, thinks a  tax holiday  on repatriated money will spur major corporations who are currently hoarding money overseas to bring that money back and invest it in America. They fail to take into account that, like other tax breaks, companies are not going to build new factories, plants, offices or stores and hire more people if consumer demand doesn t warrant it. Instead, they ll pocket the money they save in one of any number of ways, and regular Americans won t benefit one iota from it.That s what they ll do with Trump s tax holiday. This isn t speculation or conjecture, this is something to which they literally admit. Bank of America Merrill Lynch conducted a survey of more than 300 companies over the summer, asking them what they d do with all that money they bring back from overseas. Their top two responses were the following: Pay down debt, and buy back their own stocks.The idea that they d use the money for stock buybacks is especially upsetting since this is a known method for artificially driving stock prices up. Rich executives and shareholders then get even richer. Workers see no benefit from it, and the unemployed and underemployed don t see new job opportunities popping up.Literally, the whole point of this practice is to make the rich richer.When George W. did this in 2004, companies voluntarily brought over $300 million back in from overseas. $240 million went to stock buybacks. Let that sink in for a moment   80 percent of the money brought back in from overseas went to stock buybacks. Companies took advantage of that tax holiday to inflate their stock prices and get richer. There was no economic growth from that.The companies that brought back the most money actually turned right around and laid people off.Let that sink in as well.There will be no economic growth from Trump s tax break. Companies are not so broke that they can t afford to expand without some of the money they re hoarding elsewhere and protection from repatriation taxes. They don t need this money to build anything or hire new workers. This is nothing more than the government enabling companies to enrich themselves, possibly at the expense of the Americans Trump claims to love so much. The only way to spur economic growth is to help the consumer class afford to spend their money again. But we can t expect that from Trump   he parrots Republican talking points on this because he knows he can use them to make himself and his most loyal rich buddies richer.Featured image via Ron Sachs-Pool/Getty Images",0

745,"B b..but Al Gore and Barack Obama say Scientists  were exposed for manipulating climate data during the 2011 Climategate  scandal when 5,000 emails were released from scientists proving that the science behind their studies is inconclusive and mostly a result of manipulating climate data to fit the political message they were trying to convey.Three themes emerged from the emails that were released in the Climategate scandal: (1) prominent scientists central to the global warming debate are taking measures to conceal rather than disseminate underlying data and discussions; (2) these scientists view global warming as a political  cause  rather than a balanced scientific inquiry and (3) many of these scientists frankly admit to each other that much of the science is weak and dependent on deliberate manipulation of facts and data.  ForbesA new report on global warming data has now proven President Donald Trump to be right to pull out of the Paris Agreement. The report analyzed climate data such as Global Average Surface Temperature (GAST), the NOAA, and HADLEY.SHFTPLan reports: According to the report, which has been peer reviewed by administrators, scientists and researchers from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.), and several of America s leading universities, the data is completely bunk: In this research report, the most important surface data adjustment issues are identified and past changes in the previously reported historical data are quantified. It was found that each new version of GAST has nearly always exhibited a steeper warming linear trend over its entire history. And, it was nearly always accomplished by systematically removing the previously existing cyclical temperature pattern. This was true for all three entities providing GAST data measurement, NOAA, NASA and Hadley CRU.As a result, this research sought to validate the current estimates of GAST using the best available relevant data. This included the best documented and understood data sets from the U.S. and elsewhere as well as global data from satellites that provide far more extensive global coverage and are not contaminated by bad siting and urbanization impacts. Satellite data integrity also benefits from having cross checks with Balloon data.The conclusive findings of this research are that the three GAST data sets are not a valid representation of reality. In fact, the magnitude of their historical data adjustments, that removed their cyclical temperature patterns, are totally inconsistent with published and credible U.S. and other temperature data. Thus, it is impossible to conclude from the three published GAST data sets that recent years have been the warmest ever  despite current claims of record setting warming.Finally, since GAST data set validity is a necessary condition for EPA s GHG/CO2 Endangerment Finding, it too is invalidated by these research findings. (Full Abstract Report) Fox News reported on President Trump pulling out of the Paris Agreement per his campaign promise: he is leading. President Trump is withdrawing the United States from the Paris Climate Accord.It is the right decision for a number of reasons.First, the Paris Accord is being treated by many as a treaty with treaty obligations, but President Obama never submitted it to Congress for passage.Second, though President Trump could have left it in place and done nothing, his successor could have easily revived it if left in place.Third, the structure and implementation of the Paris Accord set a terrible precedent. President Obama worked for what amounts to a global agreement with voluntary measures, but those measures would impact the American economy. But, despite that impact, President Obama did not present the Paris Accord to Congress for ratification or debate. Members of the liberal establishment were outraged.Obama criticized President Trump s decision to pull out of the Paris Climate agreement with the following statement : A year and a half ago, the world came together in Paris around the first-ever global agreement to set the world on a low-carbon course and protect the world we leave to our children.It was steady, principled American leadership on the world stage that made that achievement possible.  It was bold American ambition that encouraged dozens of other nations to set their sights higher as well. And what made that leadership and ambition possible was America s private innovation and public investment in growing industries like wind and solar   industries that created some of the fastest new streams of good-paying jobs in recent years, and contributed to the longest streak of job creation in our history.Simply put, the private sector already chose a low-carbon future.  And for the nations that committed themselves to that future, the Paris Agreement opened the floodgates for businesses, scientists, and engineers to unleash high-tech, low-carbon investment and innovation on an unprecedented scale.The nations that remain in the Paris Agreement will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created.  I believe the United States of America should be at the front of the pack.  But even in the absence of American leadership; even as this Administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; I m confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we ve got. But of course, like all Champagne Socialists, their credo is  do as I say, not as I do,  with Obama jacking up his carbon footprint when abroad. Who could forget Obama s massive convoy during a recent speaking gig in Milan?The Independent Journal Review reported: Former President Barack Obama traveled to Italy this week to make a speech on climate change at the  Seed & Chips: The Global Food Innovation Summit  in the city of Milan.It seems like Obama has taken a page out of Leonardo DiCaprio s book of  do as I say, not as I do  and took a private jet to Milan. Not only that, he had a 14 car convoy to get into the city, which also included protection from above with a helicopter.It doesn t end there. According to The Daily Mail, 300 police officers were used to protect the former president.The fleet of 14 included multiple SUVs, police cars, and sedans   not to mention a few motorcycles. Here s another look at the convoy:While in Milan, Obama also met with former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who was a close partner during their respective times in office.  Gateway Pundit",0

139,"After Hurricane Harvey devastated Houston, Texas, then Irma barreled through the Caribbean on its way to Florida, two Senate Florida Senators are warning that the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will run out of disaster assistance funding on Friday unless Congress approves more money.Republicans in the House had been looking at cutting almost $1 billion from disaster accounts to help finance Donald Trump s ego-wall on the Southern Border and now that a natural disaster occurred with another expected to hit Florida, the optics would look really bad for the GOP and for the former reality show star.Trump s budget includes slashing FEMA s budget:But the response to the next Harvey could face even stricter financial constraints if President Donald Trump gets his budgetary wishes for the 2018 fiscal year, which begins October 1. The president s budget blueprint calls for FEMA s budget for state and local grants to be cut by $667 million, saying that these grants are unauthorized or ineffective.However, after Hurricane Harvey unleashed its wrath with more storms coming, Senate Republicans agreed to more than double funding to $15.25 billion to FEMA and local block grants to handle natural disasters, according to Reuters. FEMA is stretched, and, of all things, FEMA runs out of money unless we act by tomorrow,  Democrat Senator Bill Nelson said during a speech on Thursday following a letter he wrote with Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio to congressional leaders warning that more funds were necessary.FEMA had just over $1 billion on hand as of Tuesday, and that s less than half the $2.1 billion it had last week. We re not going to let money get in the way of saving lives,  FEMA director Brock Long told CBS on Wednesday.  Congress knows what they need to do.

998,"Hurricane Maria is the worst natural disaster to befall the island of Puerto Rico in nearly a hundred years. Homes are destroyed, families displaced, and an already-suffering infrastructure has been wiped out. Nearly the entire island is without power and more than 1.5 million citizens have no access to clean water, even to drink. And while the people of Puerto Rico are desperate for help and they are dying, Donald Trump has been golfing.That sounds horrible, and it is. It is fucking horrible.It s not new, it s not surprising, and it seems at this point to almost be intentional. There are some who believe his inattention is intentional, and it s pretty hard to disagree.Besides the fact that Trump was nearly a week late in even addressing the horror in Puerto Rico, he couldn t seem to stay focused while there were any football games on television   he can t stop tweeting about players sitting or kneeling during the national anthem. And now that he has turned his attention in at least a nominal way to the people of Puerto Rico, he is furious that anyone would be criticizing his response to the disaster.How can people help but criticize? When the hurricane made landfall, Trump promised all the federal resources the island could want, and understandably, that made people expect him to do that. But then he and his inner circle were invisible for four straight days, including   you guessed it   going on a golf weekend in New Jersey.

None of that is happening and yet, his supporters stick by him. However, on social media, there appears to be less enthusiasm for the amateur president.He can t defeat ISIS while banning refugees who are fleeing from terror at the hands of ISIS.

863,"If Donald Trump and his team are trying to pretend that everything is fine and nothing s wrong, they re not doing a very good job.Earlier today, Trump kicked off the morning by indulging in his habitual Twitter habit whenever he s nervous about something. Providing a distraction from former FBI Director James Comey s testimony, Trump decided to announce his pick for a new FBI Director   signaling that Trump is nervous as hell and desperate to take the heat off the Russia scandal. It turns out, his Vice President is also freaking out.Apparently, Mike Pence reacted to the release of Comey s opening statement by abruptly cancelling a scheduled interview   literally right before it was supposed to happen! Now, Pence is cowering and has gone into hiding. Here s what went down, according to PBS:Pence bailed with no warning whatsoever!Comey s released opening statement has clearly taken the White House by surprise, and everyone s in panic mode now. The White House has been on media lockdown since the release of the statement, and Pence s response surely raised suspicions.Pence, without a doubt, cancelled that interview so he wouldn t have to answer questions about Comey   because he could not only further incriminate Trump, but himself as well. Despite the fact that most of the focus has been on Trump, Pence is also in big trouble because of the Russia scandal. Trump s entire administration is in danger if he goes down.What happens tomorrow during Comey s testimony will likely change the entire direction of the Russia scandal, and it already looks as if it is going to mean bad news for Trump. All of the warning signs and red flags are present, and everyone close to Trump is now running for the hills. For Pence to cancel this interview certainly means something fishy is happening, and most of us can t wait to find out.Featured image via Alex Wong / Getty Images",0

Now we must wait and see how Trump responds.Dunford s letter makes it clear that the military values respect and non-discrimination, even if Trump does not. So when Trump claimed he made his decision based on consultations with his  generals and military experts,  was he lying? Did he just make something up to justify his decision? Did the Joint Chiefs actually approve of Trump s ban?I guess we ll learn more from Trump s impending temper tantrum.Featured Image: Alex Wong/Getty Images",0

569,"Donald Trump has decided to go through with his threat to defund the United Nations in retaliation for making a decision he didn t like.America has been the foremost leader on the international stage ever since World War II. After the war, the United States led the way in creating a more united and cooperative world by founding the United Nations to serve as a peacekeeping and humanitarian organization.The United Nations headquarters in located in New York and America has veto power and a seat on the prestigious United Nations Security Council.But now Donald Trump is preparing to slash funding to the United Nations by 50 percent, a move that would be a major blow against international cooperation and our reputation around the globe.Not only will the United Nations be cut by $5 billion, Trump s plan also makes a 37 percent cut to the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development budgets.And it s all in an effort by Trump to increase the already bloated military budget.United Nations expert Richard Gowan warned that cutting the funding would cause chaos and could cause agencies and programs within the United Nations to implode as other countries struggle to fill the gaps. Cutting the U.S. contribution would leave a gaping hole that other big donors would struggle to fill,  Gowan said.  Multiply that across other humanitarian agencies, like the World Food Program, and you are basically talking about the breakdown of the international humanitarian system as we know it. Indeed, the budget cuts could be devastating to the United Nations and threaten to bury international cooperation as we know it.Republicans have even drafted a bill directing Trump to withdraw the United States from the organization entirely.That means the United States would also be withdrawing from the World Bank, the International Court of Justice, the World Health Organization, the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and the International Atomic Energy Agency, among many others.And because the United States is cutting funding, the United Nations may look to China or Russia to replace the funding, which could pave the way for a new power structure as the United States withdraws support.It s not only a serious blow to humanitarian efforts and global peacekeeping efforts, it s a serious rejection of international diplomacy and cooperation.And it s all because Trump and Republicans did not like that the United Nations passed a resolution condemning the continued building of Israeli settlements on Palestinian territory even though such resolutions have passed before.Trump is literally defunding the United Nations because they didn t comply with his demands despite the fact that President Obama was still in office at the time.This is absolutely humiliating for the United States and it should horrify the American people that Trump is withdrawing our country from the international community. Our influence and respect throughout the world will wane because of this decision and it will be difficult to regain it.America is once again becoming an isolationist nation, and the last time we ignored the world around us over 100 million people were killed in two world wars. By ignoring the world again and the growing humanitarian crisis, we are paving the way for World War III. And make no mistake, such a war today will make the first two world wars look like minor skirmishes.Featured Image: Wikimedia",0

814,"This maniac wants  The Handmaid s Tale  to become reality.Abortion is protected by the constitution in this country. But a Wisconsin lawmaker thinks that women should be forced to get pregnant and give birth.Wisconsin state GOP Rep. Scott Allen made the horrendous remarks while criticizing a bill that would block state employees from covering abortion with their health insurance.Because he doesn t think the bill goes far enough.Seriously.Allen pitched his idea to force women to give birth, and tried to justify his idea by claiming that forcing women to give birth will somehow help the economy. Labor force shortages are tied to population declines. Labor force shortages are a limiting factor in economic growth. Limited economic growth poses a problem when government tries to pay for public services and infrastructure. In spite of this Mr. Speaker, ironically, the Democrats continue their efforts to support the abortion industry. See what he did there? Allen claims that forcing women to give birth against their will is good for the economy. I m sure he would say the same thing about slavery, too.Here s the video via Twitter.Your #saturdaymorning WTF:WI Rep. Scott Allen says women should be made to give birth for the good of the economy.?pic.twitter.com/db01mkLQMl  Holly O'Reilly (@AynRandPaulRyan) November 4, 2017Allen is, of course, wrong. The fact is that there are millions of Americans who are currently unemployed. There are more people in this country than there are jobs. More people will not solve the economic problems we face today. And if women are forced to have babies, it will only make the problem worse, especially among teens. Teen girls who get pregnant and have babies are at an economic disadvantage. Many are forced to drop out of school and forgo college, making it more difficult for them to get high-paying jobs.The lack of child care services in this country also makes it difficult for women to work and take care of their children at the same time.The cost of raising children is incredibly expensive now, and most people are struggling to get by as it is. More kids will just add more struggle and stress. This country has a sufficient labor force. The problem is that businesses would rather hire what amounts to slave laborers overseas. Wages are also too low, which prevents most people from sparking economic growth through spending. If all workers can do with the little money they get is pay bills, it leaves very little left to spend at area businesses.In the end, forcing women to have kids is unconstitutional and will do nothing to grow the economy. Forcing big business to pay worker a livable wage, however, will turn the economy into the powerhouse it once was.Featured Image: Screenshot",0
1156,"A Category Four hurricane has hit Texas. It s set to be the most disastrous hurricane since Katrina hit Louisiana in 2005, yet Donald Trump is using it as an opportunity to deport people.Thousands of people are evacuating the affected areas, trying to beat the storm. Instead of helping ensure that evacuations go smoothly, the Trump administration is doing the exact opposite. They are creating checkpoints and forcing people to show their  papers  proving they are documented residents of the United States.The federal government is closing border patrol checkpoints in the path of the hurricane, but they re leaving checkpoints open outside the path. The Texas Tribune reports: Border Patrol checkpoints will not be closed unless there is a danger to the safety of the traveling public and our agents. Border Patrol resources, including personnel and transportation, will be deployed on an as needed basis to augment the efforts and capabilities of local-response authorities,  the agency said in a statement.The Border Patrol is a law enforcement agency and we will not abandon our law enforcement duties. I m sure you can imagine the consequences. Sure, checkpoints will only be open outside the path of the hurricane, but they can still cause traffic to back up for miles. It will also all but ensure that undocumented immigrants and their families will stay behind, only to be potentially killed by the hurricane or the resulting floods.Civil rights agencies like the ACLU are furious. This is a disgusting move from the Border Patrol that breaks with past practices,  American Civil Liberties Union director of immigration policy and campaigns Lorella Praeli said.  The Border Patrol should never keep checkpoints open during any natural disasters in the United States. Everyone, no matter the color of their skin or background, is worth saving. Everyone, no matter the color of their skin or background, is worth saving.  Except to Donald Trump, they really aren t.

822,"What s happening in Flint, Michigan is absolutely criminal. Not only is the water there poisoned and leading to children being diagnosed with lead poisoning, but those who are ultimately responsible are not being held accountable. This needs to change, and several people have been calling for Michigan Governor Rick Snyder (R) to resign. He s the man who put the officials in charge who changed Flint s water source. Officials who insisted the water was safe to drink.One person stepping up and demanding accountability is actor/producer Matt Damon. He has been involved, for a while now, in providing clean water around the globe and co-founded Water.org with Gary White. Both men are absolutely appalled over whats happening in Flint, because as they work hard to bring fresh water to third world nations, people in our own nation are going without clean water. Damon told the Daily Beast: At the very least he should resign! At the very least. Listen, everybody s entitled to a fair trial in the United States of America, but that man should get one. And soon. That s just my personal opinion In terms of the work that we do, to see it happening in Flint, every parent in America feels it on a visceral, deep level, because we ask the question,  What if that was my child?  It s unconscionable in Flint, and it s unconscionable that 663 million people around the world are dealing with that every day in the developing world. Those are the communities we interact with, and that s the mission of Water.org: to end that suffering for those children, and those parents. Gary White continued that sentiment, saying: We should be outraged about Flint. That shouldn t be happening in the United States, but it also drives home the point that it shouldn t be happening anywhere. Flint is the reality for many developing countries around the world. And knowing that race and socioeconomic status definitely play a role in how certain communities are treated not only here in the United States, especially in Flint, but also around the world, Damon added: My sincere hope for our country and our world is that this greater connectivity is going to lead to a greater empathy and an awakening to the plight of our fellow citizens. These are huge systemic injustices we re talking about that hopefully everybody is waking up to. The question then is, what do we do about it? It will be interesting to see where we go from here. The first step in doing that will be to hold those responsible for this outrageous neglectful act accountable, starting with Gov. Snyder. Many, including filmmaker Michael Moore are even calling for his arrest, and asking for a thorough investigation. Unfortunately, for the people of Flint, MI, the damage is done. The harm from the lead poisoning is irreversible. Justice must be served, and resources allocated to the people of that community to deal with any and all ongoing issues. We also need to make sure this never ever happens again, not only in Flint, but everywhere in this nation and around the globe.Featured image: Wikimedia/Wikimedia",0
1018,"In light of the Russian hacking scandal that interfered in our nation s election, it seemed to many that the Obama administration was taking it lying down. It wasn t, at least according to a ground breaking report by the New York Times that says that in his final days, the President worked to create a trail leading directly from Russia to Donald Trump.In the Obama administration s last days, some White House officials scrambled to spread information about Russian efforts to undermine the presidential election   and about possible contacts between associates of President-elect Donald J. Trump and Russians   across the government. Former American officials say they had two aims: to ensure that such meddling isn t duplicated in future American or European elections, and to leave a clear trail of intelligence for government investigators.Intelligence officials had suspected something fishy as early as last summer, but the evidence was still too weak. In September, though, there was a series of cyber attacks on state voting systems. That s when the administration became more vocal on the matter. That s also when Obama s intelligence departments got very serious.But it wasn t until after the election, and after more intelligence had come in, that the administration began to grasp the scope of the suspected tampering and concluded that one goal of the campaign was to help tip the election in Mr. Trump s favor. In early December, Mr. Obama ordered the intelligence community to conduct a full assessment of the Russian campaign.In the weeks before the assessment was released in January, the intelligence community combed through databases for an array of communications and other information   some of which was months old by then   and began producing reports that showed there were contacts during the campaign between Trump associates and Russian officials.While we still don t know exactly what the Obama administration knows, we do know that there are more than a handful of Trump officials, including his Attorney General, who have confirmed contacts with Russian oligarchs, spies and government officials. That s unprecedented.Congress is also taking this very seriously. The House intelligence committee is about to investigate. We have reached a written agreement, the minority and the majority in the House intelligence committee, that we will investigate allegations of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign,  Democratic Representative Adam Schiff said on MSNBC.U.S. intelligence analysts have concluded that Russia tried to help Trump win the White House by discrediting Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and her party through cyber attacks. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, expelled Russian diplomats in retaliation in December.The Trump administration, of course, continues to deny any involvement with the Putin administration, but it s become quite clear that without Russia, we d have a President Hillary Clinton. Russia also denies any connection, but they re also distancing themselves from the now toxic Trump. Once they re done protecting him, he s done.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",0

Now that she is a private citizen who has zero intention of running for office ever again, the former First Lady, Senator, Secretary of State, and 2016 Democratic Presidential nominee can speak her mind, and she did so in spectacular fashion at a dinner on Saturday night for the Human Rights Campaign. While speaking to the nation s largest LGBTQIA rights organization, Hillary turned her attentions to Fox News, the network that seems obsessed with her, even though she is a private citizen, and their criminal orange poster boy is the one who is currently squatting in the White House. Hillary said of Fox: It does strike me that in the last few days at least, Fox News seems to think that s where I live, in the White House. Because they spend a disproportionate amount of their time talking about impeaching me. So, look, if they want to make a trade, I d be more than willing. I would have much preferred to have come to the dinner tonight from a slightly closer residence. That s a trade I d be all for   and millions of other Americans feel the same way. The deeper issue here, though, is that Fox, like the rest of the world, knows that an indictment is coming from Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Monday, and they have no way to spin their way out of this one. So, what do they do instead? Tell their brainwashed viewers that Hillary Clinton is the real criminal here, and that Donald Trump is being witch hunted by the  fake media.

1149,"Maybe you ve finally heard by now that a mosque in Bloomington, Minnesota was bombed early Saturday morning. Maybe. It seemed confusing as it was being reported, because nobody was calling it what it actually was: an act of terrorism aimed at a church. In fact, you were hard-pressed to find anyone even calling it a hate crime, despite the fact that it clearly was. Everything about the incident added up to exactly what America would have called a terrorist attack   if it had been committed by Muslims, instead of against them.In the New York Times report, details included the fact that congregants has just begun to gather for morning prayers, the fact that the bomb was thrown into the Imam s (pastor s) room, and the fact that one worshiper ran outside at the sound of the explosion just in time to see a truck speeding out of the parking lot. Just everything you might need for a terrorist attack: maximum presence, a specific target, and a fleeing suspect.When news hit the wire that it was carried out with an improvised explosive device   an IED, in the parlance of Middle East wars   you d think that would draw some response from the President of the United States. A terrorist attack on a church, using a weapon you might find in the desert of Iraq. Condemnation from every Republican in Washington, right?Not so much.Apparently there was a terrorist bombing in Minnesota today. Take one guess why Trump has said nothing about it. https://t.co/4PoyfCY4YT  Mark Follman (@markfollman) August 5, 2017Did I miss Trump's statement of concern for the victims of this bombing and members of the Mosque?Does he care? https://t.co/WIWOCewIt4  Marty Parrish (@Marty_Parrish) August 6, 2017Someone bombed a mosque in Minnesota recently. You probably didn't hear about this because mainstream media likes to demonize Muslims.  Brown Saraah (@Brown_Saraah) August 6, 2017It took until Sunday before someone finally called it a terrorist attack, and it was Minnesota s own Democratic governor, Mark Dayton, who used the appropriate language. He visited the Dar al Farooq mosque with a cadre of other public officials, and was devastated by the sight:What a terrible, dastardly, cowardly act was committed. It is a criminal act of terrorism.But Muslims across the country surely know that Trump s silence on the issue is quite purposeful. He s made it very clear that his aim since before he even secured the Republican nomination was to curtail Muslim entry into the US, to marginalize them and monitor them as though their very presence were terrorism in itself. Every attack inside the US that is perpetrated by a Muslim, whether it is related to religion, hate crimes, or simply random, is immediately branded terrorism. But crimes against them are never looked at in the same light.We must support our Muslim brothers and sisters across this country, and never allow them to be marginalized the way Trump and his fellow Republicans want them to be. If we don t hold the terrorist responsible for this attack to the same account we would demand of a Muslim attacker, we are no better than the Trump fans across the country who were no doubt secretly glad that it happened.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",0

982,"There s a lot of talk that, if Mueller indicts friends and associates of Trump over the Russia scandal, Trump will just pardon them and nobody will get punished, least of all Trump. There are two problems with that: First, to accept a pardon is to admit guilt, so he d be throwing them under the bus. But secondly, and perhaps more importantly, any pardons he issues could land him in hot water just that much sooner. According to Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), his pardoning power is not exactly absolute.Schiff told ABC News: I don t think the president s power is all that absolute, as people have been suggesting.The president cannot pardon people if it s an effort to obstruct justice, if it s an effort to prevent Bob Mueller and others from learning about the President s own conduct. So, there are limitations. This whole thing really took off when Mueller was appointed special counsel to investigate whether Trump obstructed justice when he fired James Comey. It s true that the Constitution does give the president broad power to issue pardons for  offenses against the United States.  However, we currently don t have any precedent for a president pardoning people tied to his own campaign, and rumors have been circulating that Trump wants to test his pardoning powers to see just how far they actually go.That could be part of why the Tweeter-In-Chief was panicking so badly on Twitter that he screamed,  DO SOMETHING!  in a rant about Hillary Clinton and Uranium One. He might be aware that not only is Mueller getting closer to something that implicates him, which we just can t have, but also that he can t pardon anyone Mueller indicts (or perhaps has been strongly warned away from trying).A pardon would require an admission of guilt, but it would also prevent people from flipping on Trump and singing out the truth in exchange for lesser charges or a lesser sentence. Depending on who s indicted, and what they do, the man who would be king in the White House will find it far more difficult to keep claiming that Russia is just a distraction and there s nothing to it.And so will all his lackeys.Too bad.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",0
1209,"America s creditors are now thinking twice about investing in our nation because Donald Trump s policies have turned us into a bigger credit risk.On Election night, as the returns came in favoring Trump for president the stock market took a hit and the dollar dipped in value. It soon bounced back but markets around the world and in the United States are nervous about what will happen as long as Trump continues to push an economic policy that significantly lowers taxes on the rich, slashes regulations, boosts spending like never before, and antagonizes American and foreign businesses.Trump s escalation of confrontations with Iran and China, along with European fear of an invasion by Russia have also left the future of the world economy in doubt.Trump has been erratic, paranoid, and quick to whine on Twitter and has shown a willingness to attack businesses that make decisions he disagrees with.And Donald Trump s unpredictability is forcing foreign investors to stop investing in United States Treasuries.According to Bloomberg,Across the world, foreigners are pulling back from U.S. debt like never before. From Tokyo to Beijing and London, the consensus is clear: few overseas investors want to step into the $13.9 trillion U.S. Treasury market right now. Whether it s the prospect of bigger deficits and more inflation under President Donald Trump or higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve, the world s safest debt market seems less of a sure thing   particularly after the upswing in yields since November. And then there is Trump s penchant for saber rattling, which has made staying home that much easier.Bloomberg goes on to point out that  any consistent drop-off in foreign demand could have lasting consequences on America s ability to finance itself cheaply,  which means the cost of running the federal government could skyrocket and fall upon the shoulders of struggling working class Americans who will see their taxes rise as the wealthy escape their own responsibility for providing revenues to the government.And as Trump continues to initiate trade wars against China, Japan, and other nations, it could further justify foreign investors from investing in the United States.We could be looking at an impending economic catastrophe as long as Trump continues to make America a credit risk. He wants to double down on the failed trickle-down economic policies Republicans are obsessed with and if he repeals the Affordable Care Act, that will create further chaos as the wealthy pay less in taxes and the deficit increases. Our economy is primed to implode and foreign investors see it coming. Investing in America is too risky right now, and it is only going to get worse. And Trump is to blame.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",0
595,"Recently, intelligence agencies, including the FBI, have found evidence linking Russian state-sponsored hackers as the culprits in multiple breaches of Democratic institutions and state election systems. In what is being seen as tilt-the-election in favor of Republican nominee Donald Trump (due to Democrats being the victim in all the cyber-intrusions), President Obama issued a strong warning to Russian president Vladimir Putin: don t mess with our elections.Although not mentioning the election specifically (as far as we know), President Obama warned Putin that should he start a cyber war with the United States, we would have the upper hand: I will tell you we ve had problems with cyber intrusions from Russia in the past and from other countries in the past. We re moving into a new era here and frankly, we ve got more capacity than anybody both offensively and defensively  What we cannot do is have a situation where this becomes the wild, wild West, where countries that have significant cyber capacity start engaging in unhealthy competition or conflict through these means. President Obama also urged Putin not to duplicate or continue the  cycle of escalation  when it comes to nation s hacking others for personal, political or economic gain.And that s how it s done. Trump, take note.It was reported in the Washington Post on Sunday that American intelligence officials are formally launching an investigation to find out if Russian state-sponsored hackers are planning on a disruption in November s general election:The aim is to understand the scope and intent of the Russian campaign, which incorporates  cyber-tools to hack systems used in the political process, enhancing Russia s ability to spread disinformation  A Russian influence operation in the United States  is something we re looking very closely at,  said one senior intelligence official who, like others interviewed, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter. Officials also are examining potential disruptions to the election process, and the FBI has alerted state and local officials to potential cyberthreats.It s no secret the Russians are pro-Trump, who they see as the perfect puppet for their thugs at the Kremlin. Not only do they see Trump as the way to continue their illegal, coercive and consequential actions, they have actively purchased his campaign with Paul Manafort (before he was forced to resign after it was discovered).Luckily, President Obama has the guts to stand up to Russia and their Gestapo tactics. While Trump folds like an accordion in Mexico, President Obama flexes his muscles.Don t mess with the United States  elections.Featured image via Lintao Zhang/Getty Images",0
938,"Kellyanne Conway, who serves as a senior adviser to Donald Trump, is a connoisseur of  alternative facts.  In other words, she lies so much she even believes herself. But don t call her a liar, or she ll freak out. Conway is on the offensive today after the president of her alma mater called her out for repeatedly trying to sell falsehoods to the American people as truth.Trinity Washington University President Patricia McGuire blasted Conway for her lies in a blog titled On lies and the truth we must tell.  She said Conway was  part of a team that thinks nothing of shaping and spreading a skein of lies as a means to secure power. Presidential Counselor Kellyanne Conway, Trinity Class of 1989, has played a large role in facilitating the manipulation of facts and encouraging the grave injustice being perpetrated by the Trump Administration s war on immigrants among many other issues. She is one of President Trump s primary spokespersons, an almost daily figure on cable news shows,  McGuire wrote.   Some people admire her staunch advocacy for her client s positions, and others applaud the fact that she was the first woman to manage a successful presidential campaign. But in fact, as is true of many of President Trump s statements, her advocacy on his behalf is often at variance with the truth. Ms. Conway invented the now-infamous phrase  alternative fact,  to defend Trump s claims about the size of crowds at his inauguration, a thinly-veiled autocratic scheme to try to claim that the Trump inauguration drew the biggest crowd in history when, in fact, it was on the smaller side,  she continued.  Ms. Conway has been part of a team that thinks nothing of shaping and spreading a skein of lies as a means to secure power. Perhaps the  Bowling Green Massacre  comment was truly a mistake, as she claims, but she repeated that canard on three different occasions as an explanation for why the travel ban, an executive order that clearly discriminates against Muslims, was necessary. When the Washington Post informed Conway of McGuire s comments, she didn t take it well at all. True to form, she lashed out and slammed not only McGuire s wise words, but also her fellow alumni. Because why not? It s a disappointment to have the president of the university lift up other Trinity graduates who have a casual relationship with the truth,  Conway said. She then whined that McGuire didn t even have  the courtesy of calling or emailing me to ask what I meant on any given occasion. Without addressing the fact that she has been running around making up the truth as she goes along, including the Bowling Green massacre that never happened, Conway added that she has given the school lots of money over the years. My money was good,  she noted. Apparently, writing a check means that no one is allowed to call you out for spouting lies to defend a demagogue. Sounds totally legit.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",0

224,"Every American needs to consider this new evidence about Hillary and how her campaign is helping to hide her poor health from voters unless of course, the only reason you re planning to vote for Hillary is because you like her VP candidate, Tim Kaine Why does Hillary reject a bottle of water for a glass of water during her coughing fit in front of press on her new campaign plane? Why does Hillary have a stool and GLASS OF WATER next to her at all times during public appearances? Why does Hillary tell press she s suffering from allergies when allergens aren t even high in the specific region where she s speaking? Why is Hillary resting while Donald Trump is out running circles around her on the campaign trail? Why does the media cover for her lies and MOST IMPORTANTLY, why is anyone supporting this woman who is clearly not well enough to even campaign for the highest office in our nation???During the Republican National Convention last June, two Secret Service agents approached InfoWars and asked to speak to them about Hillary s health. The Secret Service contacted me. They said that Hillary Clinton has Parkinson s disease. They [Hillary s people] spent over a quarter million dollars on these stairs to allow her to step down from the vehicle to the ground because she has trouble walking. They [Secret Service] said that any kind of flashes or strobes will set her off into a seizure, and that s why they wanted to come us.They wanted to contact us and give us information because they knew we [InforWars] would be able to get this out. [Unlike the MSM,] we wouldn t be scared to do it. And you know it really makes a lot of sense when you watch all these videos. The fact that she s refusing to do these news conferences. Hillary had not done a press conference for 8  months. Her last press conference was on December 4, 2015.DOES HILLARY HAVE PARKINSON S DISEASE?As a neurological disorder, Parkinson s disease (PD) has been shown to affect motor skills in the limbs, inhibit muscle coordination, and sometimes contribute to dysphagia.1   Dysphagia is the medical term for difficulty swallowing. Thickened liquids are often used in the management of dysphagia to improve bolus control and to help prevent aspiration. A range of starches and gums has historically been used to thicken liquids. Although thickened liquids improve swallow safety, they appear to have a great potential for unintended physiological consequences.Like this  unintended physiological consequence  maybe?  Why does Hillary always have a stool and GLASS OF WATER at every public appearance? Don t most people in this day and age drink from a bottle of water?Again the stool and the GLASS OF WATER And again On Feb. 4, WND reported Hillary Clinton has been prescribed Armour Thyroid, a natural medication made from desiccated pig thyroid glands, for her hypothyroid condition and Coumadin   a brand name of warfarin, which initially was developed as a well-known rat poison   for her congenital tendency to form blood clots.WND also reported the medication Clinton has taken since 1998 to deal with her blood-clotting problems may have side effects that are hazardous to her health, including blurred vision and confusion, both of which she has experienced. And a California physician warned Coumadin could be more life-threatening to her than the possibility of a recurring blood clot.Bill Clinton, during a question and answer session at the Peterson Foundation in Washington, on May 14, 2014, told the audience that the concussion Hillary suffered  required six months of very serious work to get over. On Nov. 16, 2015, in an exchange between Hillary Clinton s aides Huma Abedin and Monica Hanley dated Jan. 26, 2013, regarding Clinton s schedule, the aides said it was  very important  to go over phone calls with Clinton because the former secretary of state was  often confused. Clinton s five-minute bathroom break at the third Democratic debate in Goffstown, New Hampshire, on Dec. 19, 2015, initially attributed to the distance of the woman s bathroom from the stage, was reported to have caused a  flare up of problems from brain injury  that required Clinton to sit in a chair off-stage to recover from fatigue, dizziness and disorientation.WND just last week reported that at least 10 prominent physicians have been questioning Hillary Clinton s health.Based on publicly available information, the following physicians have raised concerns:  Dr. Jane Orient, M.D., executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, said images of Clinton being helped up stairs and propped up, and videos showing odd, seizure-like head movements require an explanation to voters, she contends. The author of  Emerging Diseases: Protecting Your Family from Pandemics, Viral Threats, and Rogue Vaccines  noted the  vituperation and anger  that she s faced for raising questions.  I m not making a diagnosis,  she told WND on Monday. But  I can look at the video. You can look. She said for a medical professional to simply ignore the evidence would be  completely reckless.  Meeting someone with these symptoms personally would require a  How are you?  she said.  These are not ridiculous questions.  Dr. Lee Hieb, author of  Surviving the Medical Meltdown: Your Guide to Living Through the Disaster of Obamacare,  agreed.  They made a huge deal about [Sen. John] McCain because of his melanoma,  she told WND.  Melanoma doesn t give you dementia!  She said the images and videos are evidence that should be reviewed and explained to voters, contending Clinton is  not being forthcoming. If she doesn t want the American people informed   we know where she stands. Citing Clinton s previous concussion, Hieb said such injuries can cause long-term side effects, seizures, personality changes and cognitive deficits.  The Fox News medical  A-Team  of Dr. Marc Siegel and Dr. David Samadi had questions.  In 2008   I looked over a thousand pages of John McCain s records because of a melanoma he had 10 years ago. What about Hillary? In 2009, a severe fall. She breaks her elbow. In 2011, she boards a plane, falls. In 2012, she has a severe concussion which Bill Clinton says took her six months to recover from,  Siegel said. He continued:  Then she ends up with a blood clot in the brain and a lifetime of blood thinners. Just that point alone   if she s prone to falling, you can see from that picture up there that it looked like she can barely get upstairs without two people carrying her. Guess what if she falls and hits her head? She ll get a blood clot.  Dr. Drew Pinsky s television show on the HLN cable network,  Dr. Drew on Call,  was canceled after he raised questions about Clinton s health in an interview on KABC-AM in Los Angeles. Alt-Right fanatics and conspiracy theorists  immediately questioned her health   is she ok? And concerns over Hillary s  worst coughing fit ever  was raised by MSNBC.But as Paul Josepth Watson reports, MSNBC regurgitated claims by Hillary s campaign aides that,  Allergens were high in Northeast Ohio on Monday,  before asserting that there is  no evidence to indicate she is unwell.

What about the 10 previous times? pic.twitter.com/lwDNYjhEhI  Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) September 5, 2016The problem for that propadandist line is   It was a complete fabrication.As numerous websites that track daily allergen levels confirmed, grass pollen was low, tree pollen was low and ragweed pollen was moderate.

313,"On Trump s birthday, the Washington Post published an explosive story alleging that the FBI under Mueller s direction was currently investigating Trump for obstruction of justice for his treatment of former FBI director James Comey.The special counsel overseeing the investigation into Russia s role in the 2016 election is interviewing senior intelligence officials as part of a widening probe that now includes an examination of whether President Trump attempted to obstruct justice, officials said.The move by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III to investigate Trump s conduct marks a major turning point in the nearly year-old FBI investigation, which until recently focused on Russian meddling during the presidential campaign and on whether there was any coordination between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. Investigators have also been looking for any evidence of possible financial crimes among Trump associates, officials said.Trump has no one to blame for this new line of inquiry but himself. In testimony his staff hasn t even bothered denying, Comey noted that Trump once asked everyone to leave the room before directly asking the FBI director if he could find a way to drop the Russia investigation. Then Trump fired Comey when the investigation continued. Then he went into an interview with NBC s Lester Holt and explicitly admitted that he fired Comey because he wouldn t stop investigating his connections to Russia.Rather than make his problems go away, firing Comey and Trump s subsequent confession seem to have triggered a new investigation   this time in his attempts to obstruct justice by interrupting the investigative process.Despite the avalanche of evidence against him, Trump s team had a painfully predictable response: To accuse the Washington Post of lying. In the hours after publishing, Trump staff and friends repeatedly claimed there was no investigation into Trump. They screamed  fake news. The chairwoman of the RNC went further, claiming Mueller had smeared Trump with  unfounded accusations.  (Hint: Mueller hasn t even commented publicly yet. And an investigation isn t an  accusation. )Mueller's unfounded accusation against @POTUS changes nothing. There's still no proof of obstruction of justice. https://t.co/gY7pcfD4yj  Ronna RomneyMcDaniel (@GOPChairwoman) June 15, 2017Then Trump woke up and promptly confirmed it was real.They made up a phony collusion with the Russians story, found zero proof, so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story.

960,"Donald Trump s tweeting is a source of endless nightmares for Republicans and White House staff. They can try to sugarcoat anything Trump does, but it s hard to put a positive spin on the ramblings of a clearly troubled man. A typical Trump tweet shot off in the early morning may, say, contradict an official statement. Or prove a White House talking point is a lie. Or contain basic grammar and spelling mistakes. And some have even been used in court to rule against the White House s attempted Muslim ban.Adding to that, Trump s tweets are a visual, daily reminder that our president is, at his heart, a complete moron. Take this classic two-piece of idiocy, for example:First Trump proudly announces he plans on creating a cyber team with the country that hacked America s last presidential election.Putin & I discussed forming an impenetrable Cyber Security unit so that election hacking, & many other negative things, will be guarded..  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 9, 2017Hours later, he screams that it isn t happening after Americans of all political stripes pointed out how stupid the idea was.The fact that President Putin and I discussed a Cyber Security unit doesn't mean I think it can happen. It can't-but a ceasefire can,& did!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 10, 2017His staff has privately told reporters that they spend a great deal of their time at the White House trying to find ways to get Trump to stop binge-watching Fox News and tweeting about whatever comes up on his favorite show, Fox and Friends. The struggle has, at times, descended into sheer lunacy.  During one of Trump s latest Twitter meltdowns, a despondent aide sent a reporter a simple message:Informed of the president s denial that he had recorded his conversations with Comey, a senior administration official replied,  At least that s behind us.  When alerted to his apparent suspicions of Oval Office surveillance, the official replied in a text message,  fml. What does Trump think about these attempts to save him from himself? It makes him angry.New York Times reporter Mark Leibovich filed a lengthy piece with a simple premise: The White House is a total-and-unending shitshow and Trump is at the epicenter. Leibovich was, in fact, in the room, when the idea of Trump s Twitter self-sabotage was brought up to the president. Trump s reaction speaks volumes.It was 12:30, but the president was not eating lunch. He was watching a recording of  Fox and Friends  from about four hours earlier on a large TV mounted on the wall. This was one of those stretches when Trump was tweeting a lot, including attacks on the mayor of London following a terrorist attack on the city the previous weekend. The tweets were becoming a growing topic of concern among Republicans, many of whom were urging him to stop. But like most reporters, I found his tweets far more illuminating than anything the White House press office could ever disgorge. I urged him to keep it up.Trump assured me that he would keep tweeting.  It s my voice,  Trump said of Twitter, enumerating how many millions of followers he had.  They want to take away my voice,  Trump said.  They re not going to take away my social media. In just two paragraphs, Leibovich documented Trump s insane Fox News viewing habits, the well-known patent dishonesty of the White House press office, and Trump s own spoiled brat way of looking at his Twitter habits. It takes Stephen King an entire novel to write anything half as scary as that snapshot of the man who currently controls America s nuclear arsenal.Featured image via Matt Cardy/Getty Images",0
33,"A firefighter in Ohio recently came under fire for expressing his  economic uncertainty  (a synonym the media concocted for  racism  while attempting to explain why people voted for Trump) about rescuing black people.If it came down to choosing to rescue a single dog or  a million n*ggers,  Franklin township firefighter Tyler Roysdon says he would save the dog, which is  more important than  all those African-Americans he hates.According to Roysdon s Facebook  likes,  he is a fan of Donald Trump, Duck Dynasty, and far-Right Facebook group  Uncle Sam s Misguided Children    just so you know what sort of person we re dealing with.Roysdon was suspended from his position  indefinitely  as soon as township officials learned of the post, which went viral on social media because that s what happens when terrible people say terrible things.

Upon gaining knowledge of this information, Fire Chief Steve Bishop immediately contacted the firefighter and directed the comments be removed.  The firefighter was suspended without pay until the Board of Township Trustees could meet to determine a course of action.  Chief Bishop does not have the authority to terminate employees.

And apparently, Israeli spies were correct when they said that things were a lot worse than some nice escorts  draining the swamp on Trump s bed. McClatchy s report says:Investigators are examining how money may have moved from the Kremlin to covertly help Trump win, the two sources said. One of the allegations involves whether a system for routinely paying thousands of Russian-American pensioners may have been used to pay some email hackers in the United States or to supply money to intermediaries who would then pay the hackers, the two sources said.The informal, inter-agency working group began to explore possible Russian interference last spring, long before the FBI received information from a former British spy hired to develop politically damaging and unverified research about Trump, according to the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the inquiry.Trump, who will be handed the nuclear launch codes and all of our country s secrets on Friday, has spent quite a bit of time praising, quoting, and agreeing with Vladimir Putin while attacking the intelligence agencies who are doing their jobs and attempting to bring a criminal   him   to justice. For his part, Trump has called the allegations against him a  political witch hunt  and a  complete and total fabrication,  and Americans who care about whether he colluded with the Kremlin  stupid people  and  fools.

His tweets claiming credit for job creation he had nothing to do with, plus his blasting companies when they don t do what he wants, and his threat of a 35 percent  border tax,  has businesses terrified of ending up on his radar.And how are they responding? By repeating job announcements, or preemptively announcing new jobs and investments in the U.S., as if they are new developments, in order to appease Trump and generate fake news about  new  jobs. After Trump blasted Toyota on his Twitter account, the industry was nervous and wondering who was next.Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for U.S. NO WAY! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 5, 2017He s gone after Lockheed-Martin and Boeing, too, plus others. Kristin Dziczek, a spokeswoman for the Center for Automotive Research said: Pretty much everybody is dreading being the subject of a tweet. Getting hauled out into the court of public opinion with virtually no warning is not something anybody wants to get engaged with. So they re doing the only thing they can think of to do. They re appeasing him. They ve been cowed. They ve been bullied. They ve been intimidated and coerced and it s ridiculous and disgusting.Most of the things they re announcing in the way of investment and job creation are things that are years in the making. For instance, GM admitted that they accelerated their plans under pressure from Trump, but those plans very likely date back to 2014.And GM has been bringing jobs back to the U.S. for years already.Walmart s plans are their usual annual plans. Sprint s jobs were part of an older promise from their parent company to create 50,000 jobs in the U.S. And Bayer and Monsanto, if they re allowed to merge, will be investing and spending what they already invest and spend here.Still, though, Trump has the entire corporate world running scared. If they were running scared in the right ways, this might actually be good. When they re acting because they re afraid of the president and his Twitter account, there s a serious problem.The automakers have started to time their announcements so that they appear to be Trump s doing, for the sole purpose of staying out of his line of fire. Other companies will probably start following suit, if for no other reason than to avoid having their reputations and stocks tank because Trump had a snit on Twitter.Featured image by Drew Angerer via Getty Images",0

The multi-national giant owns a lot of the brands many will most likely find in both their bathroom cabinet, such as Axe and Dove, as well as in their kitchen, with brands including Hellman s, Best Foods, and I Can t Believe It s Not Butter. The company also makes Lipton Ice Tea in a partnership with PepsiCo.But Unilever s biggest cash-cow is ice-cream, with an annual turnover of almost $6 billion. The corporation owns Ben & Jerry s, Klondike, Popsicle, and Slim Fast just to name a few, but they aren t the names that are paying the bills   It s what is officially known as the  Heartbrand  umbrella, available in over 40 countries under different names in order to retain a sense of regional familiarity, but always recognizable by its heart-shaped logo. If you have ever eaten a Magnum or a container of Blue Ribbon, you ll understand exactly how they got so big.Like most large corporations, however, it has also been discovered that Unilever is heartless at their core. This was proven after they applied to Australia s Fair Work Commission to terminate an enterprise agreement at its Heartbrand, known as  Streets,  manufacturing plant in western Sydney, Australia. It s a move that would result in workers facing pay cuts of up to 46%. Furthermore, their conditions would depreciate significantly as they would also lose existing limits on overtime, redundancy conditions, and protections against the use of labor hire and contractors among other current restrictions.Now it has come to light that Unilever is also briefing employees on how they are able to react on social media to their potential significant loss of wages and workers rights. A leaked memo from the company to employees states what constitutes the breach of company policy when posting on social media about the situation, covering everything right down to commenting with emojis.Could this two-page document pave the way to further stifling employees freedom to express their dissatisfaction? Read through and decide for yourself: The Australian Manufacturing Workers  Union have also taken on Unilever with their Say No To Streets campaign that allows protesters to email both the Streets Financial Officer and the factory Site Manager directly on the topic.Featured image via screenshot",0
971,"On Wednesday, Donald Trump took a step no previous president had ever dared to consider. He has declared that the United States now officially recognizes the city of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and announced plans to move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to the holy city.The only problem is, the city isn t just holy to the country of Israel.While Trump indicated that he wasn t  taking a position  on any contested land, that s really a misleading statement, since declaring Jerusalem as the capital of Israel in effect gives the city to the Israelis, a position that essentially declares the debate on who all of the land belongs to over.Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator in the peace process, was quick to respond, saying that Trump had  destroyed any possibility of peace  and that he was  pushing this region towards chaos [and] violence. Mustafa Marghouti, an independent Palestinian politician, told Al-Jazeera that: This is not a single act. This US administration that did not speak even once about a two-state solution. This American administration did not say or mention the words  Palestinian state  once. This American administration has failed to exercise any pressure on Israel on the issue of settlements, although Israel has enhanced settlement activities in the occupied territories by no less than 100 percent since President Trump was elected. Many expect to see outrage across the Middle East as news of the decision comes in.The European Union, for their part, insists that their position has not changed, and issued a statement almost immediately declaring that they intended to continue working toward recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of two distinct states   Israel AND Palestine.Just as he does here at home, Trump seems to be uniting people against him, even some that seem to be unlikely pairings. Both the President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and King Abdullah II of Jordan warned that ignoring the Palestinian, Muslim, and Christian rights in Jerusalem will only fuel further extremism and undermine the war against terrorism. But the decision does make Trump s evangelical supporters in America happy. Their desire to hasten the end of days has been a constant source of bafflement for those seeking to understand the strange relationship between the Jewish state and evangelicalism.

164,"There s a disturbing trend happening in Democratic circles this primary season that, if left to fester, could spell absolute disaster for the party and our country come November. As Bill Maher pointed out Friday night on Real Time, there are a growing number of Bernie Sanders supporters joining a movement called #BernieOrBust who have vowed to stay home in November if Hillary Clinton is the nominee.This is, of course, the single dumbest thing anyone looking to improve our country s already improving socioeconomic landscape could possibly do. Regardless of your feelings about Hillary Clinton s platform, record or ties to big business, the alternative is complete disaster. By removing support for your party s candidate you are effectively handing the White House to the Republicans. That socioeconomic progress I mentioned? Kiss it goodbye.The country will be thrust right back into economic crisis as regulations disappear. The already established nuclear deal with Iran will be tossed aside and the precision targeting strategy against ISIS will be scrapped in favor of all-out, boots on the ground war in the middle east. The Judicial branch of our government will see at least one and probably at least three new ultra-conservative justices, giving free reign to bigotry in this country under the guise of  religious liberty.  Gay marriage will be a thing of the past. Voter suppression and gerrymandering will run rampant, making it nearly impossible for logic and reason to ever take hold in our country again. Roe v Wade could very well be overturned, and Citizens United will not only be cemented in but built upon, taking the power of the people and handing it to the highest bidder.All of that because Bernie supporters don t like Hillary Clinton? It s ridiculous. Maher is himself a huge Bernie supporter, having publicly endorsed him and shown great enthusiasm about the direction he wants to take the country, but as he points out, if Hillary Clinton is the nominee, it would be incredibly stupid for anyone calling themselves a liberal or progressive to hand the election to a Republican, none of whom amount to half the person Hillary or Bernie are.Bernie Sanders is a great man who would do great things for this country if elected President. Hillary Clinton is a great woman who would do great things for this country if elected President. Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio are all fringe right lunatics who would destroy this country for the good of the one percent.

Alas, like so many of Trump s criticism of Hillary, his team s own security efforts are much, much worse.To prove this point, tech site Gizmodo created a  test  to see how well Trump s staff handles email security. Adding even more fuel to the fire, they also included James Comey   who had played a central role in perpetuating lies about Hillary Clinton s emails in the days leading up to the election.Three weeks ago, Gizmodo Media Group s Special Projects Desk launched a security preparedness test directed at Giuliani and 14 other people associated with the Trump Administration. We sent them an email that mimicked an invitation to view a spreadsheet in Google Docs. The emails came from the address [email protected], but the sender name each one displayed was that of someone who might plausibly email the recipient, such as a colleague, friend, or family member.Disturbingly, a number of Trump associates fell for it.Some of the Trump Administration people completely ignored our email, the right move. But it appears that more than half the recipients clicked the link: Eight different unique devices visited the site, one of them multiple times. There s no way to tell for sure if the recipients themselves did all the clicking (as opposed to, say, an IT specialist they d forwarded it to), but seven of the connections occurred within 10 minutes of the emails being sent.Even more disturbing, both Newt Gingrich and (now former FBI director) James Comey seemed to buy into the premise, while remaining slightly skeptical. Comey, for instance, asked the sender to explain to him what was in the attached document. Surely a better response than just clicking on it, but still dangerous. By asking a potential hacker to explain him or herself, the (former) FBI director only opened the door to further chances to be hacked. He also appeared to believe the email was really from a friend based solely on the name attached the the email account.Is it legal to do this? Some journalists were skeptical.@ashleyfeinberg Did did Gizmodo send the FBI director a spoofed email and then confess to the federal crime at the FBI director s expense on Gizmodo?  Brian Beutler (@brianbeutler) May 9, 2017However, Gizmodo s defense is pretty solid. For starters, they never collected any actual passwords or contact information for any of the recipients (regardless of whether the marks took the bait). Secondly, they slapped so many disclaimers on the emails that you would have to be extremely oblivious to not understand what was happening   a test which, it turns out, some of Trump s friends seem to have failed.For journalistic reasons it provides a lot of insight into just how susceptible some of Trump s closest advisers are to being hacked. Far from having the moral high ground to lecture Democrats, it turns out that Trump s team is comprised of technology-challenged suckers capable of exposing a lot of sensitive information to would-be hackers. If Gizmodo can trick them with an email containing numerous disclaimers that this was a potential hack, a real hack   infinitely more subtle   could be a serious threat.Comey himself acknowledged that it appears Russian attempts to hack America s democracy appears to be ongoing and warned that it would likely rear its ugly head in 2018 and 2020. He should be extra cautious.Meanwhile, it s unlikely that Trump will be able to appropriately respond to this threat. He may not even recognize it exists. He talked a mean game about Hillary s email security, but the closest he ever came to commenting on his own understanding of cyberwarfare was claiming his 10-year-old son Barron was good with computers. Given that level of ignorance, Trump isn t likely to start leading by example.Yikes.Featured image via Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images",0

242,"Sean Hannity threw a massive temper tantrum on Monday night in defense of Donald Trump.The Fox News host went off on a seriously delusional rant about Hillary Clinton, even referring to her as  President Clinton  on two occasions.Hannity whined about the indictments against Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, and just like Donald Trump, attempted to shift the focus from Trump s Russia collusion to Hillary Clinton. This is beyond insanity and it s inexcusable,  Hannity whined.  Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, the Obama Administration allowed your national security to be compromised in what is an unprecedented way and few in the media will touch this story. Major crimes were committed. They knew about it. They did nothing before the deal. Hannity is referring to the Uranium One deal the Obama Administration made with Russia back in 2010. Trump himself has been bellowing about it for quite some time now in a desperate effort to distract from his very real crimes.Basically, the deal gave a Russian company no more than a 51 percent stake in a Canadian-based mining company and ownership of  20 percent of the currently licensed uranium in-situ recovery production capacity in the U.S. This deal does not harm our national security as Hannity claims, nor did Hillary Clinton personally approve of the deal. Factcheck.org recently gave a run-down of the deal and thoroughly debunked Trump and Hannity s claims. As we ve written before, there is no evidence that donations to the Clinton Foundation from people with ties to Uranium One or Bill Clinton s speaking fee influenced Hillary Clinton s official actions,  FactCheck.org wrote.  That s still the case. In fact, not only did such a deal require approval from several federal agencies and committees, only 11 percent of overall U.S. production of uranium comes from Uranium One. And that uranium is sold to operators of commercial nuclear reactors. Basically, the uranium is being sold to us as it would have if Uranium One was not held by a Russian company. This deal was under a lot of scrutiny before it went through, and was even publicly announced. But Hannity did not utter one word about it when it happened.Of course, Hannity is still insisting that the evidence is on Trump s side despite the fact that there is a lot of evidence proving that he and Trump are full of shit and that Trump committed treason to steal an election. We are at a major crisis point in America tonight. Do we have equal justice under the law in this country today? If you or I or anybody in this room with me now or watching TV with you, if we ever did anything close to what the Clintons, the DNC, and others did, we would be rotting in a jail cell tonight hoping our friends would send us a cake that had a file. The only difference between Trump/Russia collusion is that we have the evidence, and after a year of black helicopter conspiracy theories, they have none. And just like we have the evidence, when it comes to Clinton and her email server scandal, why hasn t she been charged? Here s the video via YouTube.Hillary Clinton has not been charged because she didn t commit any crimes and there is ZERO evidence that she did. Trump, on the other hand, is about to go down for collusion.Clearly, nobody gives Trump a blowjob like Sean Hannity. And frankly, he and Fox News should be sued for slander.Featured Image: Screenshot",0
599,"Here s a new low for America: During the unfolding tragedy in England, NBC announced that it would not be displaying the messages of Donald Trump, the President of the United States, because his tweets were spreading potential lies.Pres. Trump has used Twitter to share news report on London incident.We aren't relaying president's retweet, as the info is unconfirmed.  NBC Nightly News (@NBCNightlyNews) June 3, 2017Trump decided the minutes after a possible terror incident in London would be a good time to retweet fear-mongering speculation from the right-wing conspiracy site Drudge Report. His action may have done one of two equally disgusting things: He either amplified the terror being spread by a terror attack (thereby doing the work of the terrorist) or he spread misinformation and rumors thereby needlessly scaring people because of his eagerness to exploit a tragedy.Either way, people were appalled.But Trump wasn t done.Rather than wait for the facts to come in, Trump immediately seized on the moment to renew his push for a Muslim ban in the United States. British officials hadn t even confirmed the number of dead and wounded, and Trump was busy using the tragedy to promote his own bigoted policies an ocean away. It would take him three tweets before he got around to expressing concern for the victims.Trump has been increasingly relying on unreliable right-wing conspiracy sites to get his information. As president, he regularly receives extremely detailed information about world events from experts in the intelligence community, but his animosity towards the officials in the FBI and CIA, and his general dislike of reading makes him often ignore the valuable intel. Instead, he chooses to get his information from Drudge, Fox News, and InfoWars. The right-wing media sites are notoriously unscrupulous. InfoWars, for example, endorsed the theory that the Sandy Hook school shooting was staged by Obama as a pretext to taking people s guns. Drudge routinely gets facts wrong in its rush to promote fear and intolerance in its extremely right-wing audience.Two hours later, Trump finally deleted the Drudge Report tweet   which puts him in an awkward position because it technically violates federal law to do so. His advisers might want to tell him that the best way to avoid that is by not spreading Drudge Report tweets in the first place.Briefed by top National Security officials in the nation.Retweets Drudge.UnRetweets it.Unpresidented. pic.twitter.com/LhKqmD0zn2  Karen DaltonBeninato (@kbeninato) June 3, 2017Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",0
439,"As more and more leaks get out, it s obvious that Donald Trump is not just a dictator, he s so insecure that aides have to hand him daily pacifiers in the form of fake and flattering news stories to keep the man baby from having even more Twitter meltdowns.The key to keeping Trump s Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady stream of praise. And when no such praise was to be found, staff would turn to friendly outlets to drum some up   and make sure it made its way to Trump s desk. If candidate Trump was upset about unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he was getting fair coverage from outlets that were persuadable,  said former communications director Sam Nunberg.  The same media that our base digests and prefers is going to be the base for his support. I would assume the president would like to see positive and preferential treatment from those outlets and that would help the operation overall. Source: PoliticoApparently Trump s constant accusations of  fake news  has some legitimacy, but not how Trump or his supporters would like.Trump is quite selective about where he gets his news. He does read print, like the New York Times, but he also watches a lot   a lot   of Fox News. Remember when Trump touted a terrorist attack in Sweden that never happened? That allegedly came straight from Fox News.My statement as to what s happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @FoxNews concerning immigrants & Sweden.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 19, 2017It was a fake story. We can t say whether it was planted by Trump s aides, but it might as well have been for all the anti-immigrant political fodder it provided.The ramifications of a president who has to be sheltered from the real news are chilling. As the administration rolls on, Trump will continue to make adversaries around the world and in the media. Trump s unfiltered Twitter habit is potentially a national security issue. His aides obviously see this, but a president who is completely out of touch with reality, and is only willing to acknowledge fawning praise is equally dangerous.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images",0

1151,"Critics are calling former Fox News host, Megyn Kelly s upcoming interview with the conspiracy theorist and noted lunatic, Alex Jones on her new home at NBC an act of irresponsibility to the public. Or, as the panel of media critics on CNN s Reliable Sources put it, Jones is a virus and Kelly is giving him the opportunity to create a viral outbreak of bullshit political positions. Maureen Ryan, Variety s chief television critic, argued that the context of the interview was a major factor in determining the quality of the programming. She asserts that Jones is certainly worth educating people about but feels the format is all wrong. Ryan explains: I just think the context in which this coverage takes place is really important. If you were telling me that NBC was doing an hour-long documentary on the rise of this kind of disinformation media empires, I would say that s great. This is important to take into consideration, both as a media critique and as a talking point to those who wish to decry the media s admonishment of Kelly and NBC as simply being part of a conspiracy to shut out so-called  truth-tellers  like Jones.  A talking point that is both in vogue with the alt-right and quite lazy, if I am being honest.   I don t think giving Alex Jones 15 or 16 minutes to simply spin his views and to spin his media image is the way in which to attack this,  Ryan went on to add.  Megyn Kelly has not proven herself to be the kind of dogged interviewer that would be able to make a meal of this. Kelly s entire career could be used as a citation for this claim, though Kelly s recent pathetic interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin does a great job of summarizing her consistent failings as a news celebrity (I m incapable of referring to her as a journalist at this point). The show s host, Brian Stelter, mentions one defense of NBC s airing of the interview that came from NBC. The defense, according to Stelter, is that:  terrorists and child molesters and serial killers have been interviewed on television. It s actually quite sad to hear such vapid analysis from a major broadcasting company like NBC, if not surprising. Obviously, there is a defense between the likes of Jones and the rest of the scary cadre of deplorable individuals that are mentioned, those types of people are almost always automatically viewed as illegitimate by audiences. It s hard to imagine Jones on the other hand, as stacking up to these types of criminals. As nutty as Jones is, he sounds sane, if not by much from a left-wing perspective, when compared to a terrorist spokesperson. Stelter goes on to speculate on whether the current political climate is playing a part in people s anger towards Kelly and NBC.: Alex Jones is a virus. There s maybe a fear of spreading that virus more fully on a big network. If it bleeds it ledes,  goes the journalist cliche. While an interview with Jones likely won t lead to blood spilling, it will get people to tune in to view the verbal carnage. This interview is going to be very profitable to NBC. It should be remembered by all, that NBC is a corporation and their obligations are to turn a profit, which even in dark times we are in still appears to trump their obligations as a member of the fourth estate.You can watch the segment below.Featured image from video screenshot",0

1033,"Imagine you just heard on the news that  the strongest storm ever observed in the Atlantic  was headed your way, and soon. You would, like anyone concerned for themselves and their family, want to get out as soon as possible. And the quickest way to evacuate from anywhere is the fastest method of travel on earth: Air. But you hit a small snag. You don t have the goddamn fortune that the airlines are now charging for flights that were less than half as much the day before. That has to be against the law, right?Wrong. In Florida, where Hurricane Irma is bearing down like a banshee, there are price-gouging laws like there are in every state. But airlines don t answer to specific states. They re regulated by the FAA and the Department of Transportation, which means no state or local statutes apply to them.So when Lisette Diaz tried to book a flight to get her family out of South Florida, she found that flights from the area   during what is normally a lull in the travel season in Florida   had skyrocketed from a few hundred dollars to over $3,000. Trying to get to New York, she finally settled on tickets out of Fort Lauderdale that cost upwards of $1,300 per traveler. According to the Miami Herald, there were four people traveling with her, including her mother, grandmother, adult cousin, and 11-year-old sister. $6,600 later, she had her tickets.Diaz was far from the only person to run into price gouging. Florida s Attorney General Pam Bondi activated the state s price-gouging hotline for travelers to report these egregious acts.The Herald reported that Antonio Mercurius actually got his tickets from Miami to D.C. on Monday, before the pricing spikes. Out of curiosity, he checked the price of the same ticket the next day and found it had gone up more than 800% per ticket. Said Mercurius,I understand supply and demand but the laws of capitalism should not operate in the times of catastrophic danger. What happens to the people that can t afford flights now?People trying to evacuate responsibly before the storm vented their frustration on Twitter:@AmericanAir really charging $2000 for a flight from Miami to DC.

Strong source just told me something I suspected. Hillary s debate  bathroom break  wasn t that, but flare up of problems from brain injury,  wrote John Cardillo on Twitter.Cardillo, who previously worked as an officer who provided VIP security details for the New York Police Department (NYPD), told Breitbart News that he knows of two additional sources who have commented about Clinton s health problems, which have even impacted her ability to walk to her car after delivering a speech. I got this from both a [federal agent]   and I also got it from a New York [NYPD] guy who worked security at a Hillary event in New York City,  Cardillo told Breitbart News, adding:These are two people that aren t just personal friends. I worked with one and then post law-enforcement worked with another on some related things. So, these aren t anonymous people. These are good friends. Both of them told me the same thing, that after her speeches, whether she did a talk or a policy speech, she had to sit behind   she would come off the podium backstage   and have to sit and rest before making it back to the car because she was so fatigued, dizzy and disoriented.Cardillo said these two security officials don t know each other and do not live in the same state, but  their stories were almost identical. One of the men told him that Clinton was  very pale, kind of disoriented. He said she looked like she was about to faint. She was very pale, almost sweaty. Cardillo said one of the incidents occurred while she was Secretary of State. The event worked by the NYPD official was roughly a year ago.Veteran Republican strategist Roger Stone, who previously worked with GOP frontrunner Donald Trump, told Breitbart News that he has also heard about Clinton s long-term health problems. A number of New York Democrats, very prominent, well-known, wealthy New York Democrats, told me last year that Hillary had very significant health issues and that they were surprised that she was running in view of her health problems and her lack of stamina,  Stone told Breitbart News.  So far, she s run a very controlled campaign, I don t think she has the physical stamina to be president,  he stated.  I have no doubt that Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) won t call her on it, but Trump certainly would. We also know that in the emails, of course, Huma Abedin  says that she is easily confused,  Stone added, referencing Clinton s close confidant Abedin comment in an email,  She s often confused,  referring to Clinton.Trump, Stone s former boss, certainly hasn t been shy in questioning whether Clinton has the  stamina  to be president. She goes out and she sees you guys for about 10 minutes, she sees you for a little while, it s all rehearsed and staged,  Trump said in a recent interview on Fox News  Media Buzz. They ll pick a couple of people out of the audience that are like, you know, 100 percent. She ll sit around a little plastic table, they ll talk to the people for a while. It s ridiculous,  Trump added.  And then she goes away for five or six days and you don t see her. She goes to sleep. Neurologist Dr. Daniel Kassicieh, D.O., reviewed news reports of Clinton s head injury in light of the recent information revealed from the security sources that are raising questions about her current health status.Kassicieh, who has run his own Sarasota, Florida, practice for 20 years, is a board-certified neurologist and the medical director of the Florida Headache and Movement Disorder Center. He is a doctor of osteopathic medicine, which is similar to a medical doctor but can involve at a minimum of 100 more classroom hours of specific training. That additional training is focused on the osteopathic or the musculoskeletal system aspects of medicine. He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Neurology (FAAN) and a Fellow of the American College of Neuro-psychiatrists (FACN). Kassicieh is a registered Republican in Sarasota, but his purely medical analysis is troubling for Clinton. They were trying to poo-poo this off as a minor concussion, but I would just say that reading it and trying to take all the politics out of it, and just read it purely from a medical standpoint,  Kassicieh explained:Considering the point of what happened with Hillary over this time period  the timeline  and then what has happened here more recently  the break at the debate, I saw that and even the commentators that were sitting there made a comment that,  Gee, that seems awful long for a break.  Just looking at it from a neurological standpoint, the risk factors for developing post-concussion syndrome, one of them is age, and she was 65 when this happened  just from a physiologic standpoint that s an older individual. Being female is a risk factor for post-concussion syndrome as well. For someone who has treated many post-concussion syndrome patients and that s what I really believe she s suffering from based on reading these reports and reading what s happened,  Kassicieh said.  I think she has latent post-concussion syndrome, and I can understand that as a politician they would want to be covering that up.  He stated:I would say as a neurologist having seen many post-concussion syndrome patients that I would not want a president who I knew had post-concussion syndrome being president because their super high-level cognitive abilities are clearly impaired and even their routine multitasking high-stress abilities are affected because post-concussion syndrome patients in general don t tolerate even moderate work, stress-related environments.Kassicieh added that if suffering from post concussion syndrome, Clinton s symptoms could appear  well beyond a year  after her concussion. A transverse sinus thrombosis [blood clot] is a rare condition of a clot forming in the venous sinus cavities surrounding the brain,  Kassicieh told Breitbart News, referencing an ABC News report from 2012 that detailed Clinton s head injury and blood clot following a fall. He explained:These venous sinuses drain blood out of the brain. The [injury] incidence is only about 3 per 1,000,000 adults. The transverse sinus is less commonly affected than the main sagittal venous sinus. The cause of transverse sinus clots is not well understood although trauma and dehydration have been described as risk factors. Mrs. Clinton suffered from both.Dr. Nicholas C. Bambakidis also analyzed the facts for Breitbart News. He is the director of cerebrovascular and skull base surgery, and the program director of neurological surgery at University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland, Ohio, and a professor of neurosurgery and radiology at the CWRU School of Medicine in Cleveland, These types of clots are usually formed spontaneously without an obvious cause,  Bambakidis said in an email:They can be associated with dehydration, a predisposition to blood clotting disorders, are more common in women and may be associated with oral contraceptive medication, severe head trauma, brain surgery, or infection. If untreated, they can progress and lead to bleeding in the brain or swelling, and a stroke or even death. The treatment is generally anticoagulation and treatment of any underlying cause.Bambakidis said that if treated early and quickly, there are no longstanding issues with a person s health. Typically, if caught early and treated adequately (as seems to have been done in this incident) there is a full recovery without any consequences (normal cognition, memory, etc),  he said.Dr. Jane Orient, the executive director of the politically conservative Association of American Physicians and Surgeons also reviewed the 2012 ABC News report about Clinton s concussion and blood clot. She said she thought the ABC report appeared medically accurate. Factors predisposing to clots include air travel, dehydration, hormones, immobilization as during surgery, blood abnormalities, cancer,  Orient said.  Concussions can cause long-term damage including cognitive problems, even when standard studies including CT or MRI look normal. Not saying Mrs. Clinton has any of the above just speaking generally and hypothetically,  she clarified.For entire story: Breitbart News",0

Now that Trump s economy is in effect, we doubt he ll be tweeting about the labor market losing 33,000 jobs last month.While some of this can be attributed to natural disasters, Trump has also failed to pass any major legislation.Job growth in August and July was revised down, to 38,000 less than previously reported. Economists expected 75,000 new jobs instead of a 33,000 job loss.The economy has added an average of 172,000 jobs a month over the past year but that has dropped to a 91,000 average over the past three months, showing a trend which is not in Trump s favor.Axios reports:Economists widely blame the disruptive effects of Hurricanes Irma and Harvey for the disappointing number, because the survey methodology dictates that folks who didn t get paid on the pay period that included September 12th are not counted as employed.But the report also revised down the two previous monthly estimates of job growth, suggested the slowdown is not all weather related.After Obama took office, he had quite a task on his hands in dealing with the cost of his predecessor s wars, but he did it. Obama s economy took an upward swing, even after natural disasters such as Hurricane Sandy and the floods which ravaged Louisiana. Throughout his campaign, Trump called Obama s economy  a disaster  but compared to other presidents, that was far from the truth.Fact: Obama took office during the worst recession since the Great Depression when the economy was losing 750,000 jobs a month and already had lost a record 9 percent of GDP. Obama started with a weak economy due to his predecessor s decisions but his final jobs report showed 75 consecutive months of growth.The unemployment rate, however, just fell to 4.2 percent, and we re sure Trump will bring that up. Let s see how long that lasts because the former reality show star is now making war noises toward North Korea. Also, if Trump manages to get the GOP tax proposal in the works, we ll see more reports like this one.But for a guy whose  presidency  has been based on undoing everything Obama has done, he sure did a good job of that with the first loss of jobs reported in 7 years.Photo: Alex Wong via Getty Images.

250,"Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates has judged both Republican and Democratic residential candidates for their ideas on foreign policy, but it s clear that he only believes that there s one nominee that is  beyond repair    Donald Trump.Gates, who has served under George W. Bush as well as Barack Obama, recently published a brutal op-ed in the Wall Street Journal that examines both Trump and Hillary Clinton for their plans on handling America s challenging relations with nations like Russia, China and the Middle East.Although Clinton was nowhere near exempt from criticism, Gates saved his harshest words for her GOP rival. Gates noted that the former Secretary of State has much-discussed credibility issues apart from national security, but these also influence foreign perceptions of reliability and trust.  However, Trump is  in a league of his own  when it comes to credibility.Gates reminded Americans that Trump openly supports and shines praise on leaders like Vladimir Putin and Saddam Hussein, and is all for unethical torture practices and the killing of terrorist s families. Gates also mentioned the fact that Trump likes the idea of Japan and South Korea developing nuclear weapons. Gates said: At least on national security, I believe Mr. Trump is beyond repair. He is stubbornly uninformed about the world and how to lead our country and government, and temperamentally unsuited to lead our men and women in uniform. He is unqualified and unfit to be commander-in-chief. As soon as Gates  op-ed was discovered by Trump, the business mogul predictably went on Twitter to throw one of his infamous man-baby temper tantrums:TwitterTo challenge Trump s tweet, NPR Morning Edition reporter Steve Inskeep invited Trump to an interview about foreign policy on his show, which the Trump campaign had said they d do about 250 days ago.TwitterAs expected, the Trump campaign has now fallen silent on the subject.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla and Spencer Platt / Getty Images",0

732,"If you thought the Republican Party was going to drop their Planned Parenthood witch hunt after the indictment of their criminal  whistleblowers  David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt, you don t know the GOP very well. Honest people might back away from the fraudulent baby parts videos and admit they d been had, but we all know that the right-wing Teapublican lawmakers aren t the brightest, nor most ethical, crayons in the box. Instead of dropping their investigation, lawmakers have decided to keep wasting your tax dollars   all while claiming the country is broke.According to the Huffington Post, Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) released a letter in the wake of the indictment and assured her fellow pro-fetusers that she would not give up the war against women: We will continue to gather information and get the facts about medical practices of abortion service providers and the business practices of the procurement organizations who sell baby body parts. These are issues of importance to the American people. We will study the laws on the books and follow the facts to defend life. What?This is how great the chasm between reality and fiction is for these people. She knows that the videos have been debunked, and yet she continues to insist that the beloved women s health organization is selling baby parts. Not even felony indictments can make her admit that her party was one hundred percent WRONG and she s not the only one. Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee and a plethora of other Republicans have all said that they support federal investigations into PP.Rep. Brian Babin (R-Texas) said he was  disappointed and shocked  by the grand jury s decision. He even went so far as to defend David Daleiden for his illegal behavior: It s deeply offensive and ridiculous that those who illegally sell aborted human body parts get a pass   while these two pro-life defenders are indicted for using aliases to expose Planned Parenthood s unlawful and disgusting practices of selling baby body parts. This decision begs the question: how else could they get the truth? The real question is: How much proof do Republicans need before they stop attacking Planned Parenthood and women across the country? I guess that s stupid of me to ask, after all, how many Benghazi hearings have we had?Perhaps the worst part of all of this is that they really don t care about decreasing the number of abortions in this country. If they did, they d support contraception and comprehensive sex education. If they were really  pro-life  they d fully support things like WIC, food stamps, free medical care and free education for all children. What it all really boils down to is that they loathe women and want to punish us in any way they possibly can   even if that means killing us by destroying a health care organization that provides critical care for millions of men too.Featured image via Twitter",0

1038,"Big brother is alive and well 3 months only 3 months In Obamaland surveillance on Muslim terror suspects is considered Islamaphobia, surveillance on Black Lives Matter riots is considered racism, but surveillance on law-abiding gun owners is an important crime-fighting tool. It turns out that federal agents have been spying on customers at guns shows and tracking their movements. Why? Because the current administration is hostile to legal gun ownership and completely inept.The Wall Street Journal originally broke this story but they have a stupid business model and put the article behind a pay wall. Thankfully there is this thing called the Internet where all information is available for free and Fox News has the scoop:The first problem you may notice in this illegal surveillance is how insanely pointless the operation is. There was no way this would ever yield any results if you understand California gun law. The Golden State does not have the  gun show loophole  that liberals love to blame for all crimes involving a gun. Even at a gun show, a person purchasing a firearm must undergo a background check and wait 10 before taking possession of the weapon.All gun transfers in California go through a federally licensed firearms dealer with no exceptions. Handgun purchases are limited to one every 30 days and require additional licensing. The state maintains a firearms registry. This is the last place in America where a person would try to make a straw purchase. Even less so for someone trying to buy guns, smuggle them into Mexico, and arm the drug cartels.On top of all that, California also bans many popular handguns and all  assault rifles.  Do the feds really think there is a vibrant black market in Mexico for California-compliant weapons? Apparently so.And despite the feds  claim, this was completely illegal it is most certainly not. The government can t just start spying on Americans without probable cause that a crime is being committed. The feds went fishing here and they forgot to bring bait, rods, and reels. They also didn t pick a spot with any fish.If the feds want to know how guns are getting from the US to Mexico they should go ask former Attorney General Eric Holder who green-lit Operation Fast and Furious. In that, the BATF let guns  go walking  from US gun stores right into the hands of the Mexican drug cartels. One of those guns was used to kill a US border patrol agent. Via: Downtrend",0

171,"If any other American company did this, Donald Trump would be attacking them on Twitter.But Trump has a double standard when it comes to his own business and the businesses owned by his family members.As you may recall, Trump has openly attacked Ford, General Motors, and a slew of other companies for building factories overseas instead of building them here and hiring American workers to do the jobs.Trump even attacked a Japanese automaker for building a factory in Mexico instead of in the United States.The hypocrisy here is that while Trump is attacking these companies for not hiring Americans, his own son is begging the Labor Department to let him hire foreign workers instead of giving jobs to Americans.Eric Trump owns Trump Vineyards, and for the second time he is asking the Labor Department to let him hire foreign workers.According to the petition filed, the workers would be paid over $11 an hour to perform manual labor in cold weather. Workers would also be exposed to chemicals and would have to lift up to 60 pounds of grapes onto a truck.Here s a screenshot of the specific section.Again, this is hypocritical. Donald Trump is constantly promising Americans that he will make sure they have jobs but his own son wants to hire foreign workers.This is yet another example of Trump not following the rules he s setting for everyone else.A real leader leads by example and if Trump refuses to tell his own son to hire American workers why should companies like Ford comply with his demands?Keep in mind that Trump is ordering raids to round up undocumented immigrants because Trump claims they take jobs away from Americans. The reality, however, is that these immigrants take jobs that most Americans do not want to perform, such as managing and harvesting crops. That doesn t mean there aren t American out there who wouldn t take them, and that means Eric Trump is taking jobs away from Americans by trying to hire foreign workers instead. That s shameful, especially since his dad promised to put America first.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",0

500,"Damn! Donald Trump is in need of a private lawyer to help him with the Russian avalanche that s about to come tumbling down upon him and his administration, but at least four top law firms have told Donald Trump, in no uncertain terms, to f*ck off.The law firms are on to Trump. He is too stubborn to listen to their advice (as his out of control Twitter account proves) and he s a deadbeat, which 50 years of Trump in the business world has proven.Trump is currently represented by an attorney. Marc E. Kasowitz has been representing Trump in real estate matters for years, and not surprisingly, he s considered quite ruthless. But he doesn t know his way around Washington, D.C. or around the D.C. press. Trump had to settle upon Kasowitz after at least four major firms said no to the petulant and out of control BLOTUS.Among them, sources said, were some of the most high-profile names in the legal profession, including Brendan Sullivan of Williams & Connolly; Ted Olson of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher; Paul Clement and Mark Filip of Kirkland & Ellis; and Robert Giuffra of Sullivan & Cromwell.Source: Yahoo.comSome in the firms said there were conflicts with other clients, or that they simply didn t have the time, but, according to Yahoo:A consistent theme, the sources said, was the concern about whether the president would accept the advice of his lawyers and refrain from public statements and tweets that have consistently undercut his position. The concerns were,  The guy won t pay and he won t listen,  said one lawyer close to the White House who is familiar with some of the discussions between the firms and the administration, as well as deliberations within the firms themselves.The other problem is that Trump is so polarizing, the firms are afraid they would lose business by defending him.Another lawyer briefed on some of the discussions agreed that the firms were worried about the reputational risk of representing the president. One issue that arose, this lawyer said, was  Do I want to be associated with this president and his policies?  In addition, the lawyer said, there were concerns that if they took on the case,  Who s in charge?  and  Would he listen? This doesn t bode well for Trump. James Comey is set to begin testifying about what he knows about Trump and his Russian connections on Thursday. Trump is without qualified legal counsel. His lawyer is drafting a defense strategy, but as with his client, he s unprepared for the job.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images ",0
1053,"Republicans have had seven years to come up with a viable replacement for Obamacare but they failed miserably. After taking a victory lap for gifting the wealthy with a tax break on Wednesday, Donald Trump looked at the cameras and said,  We have essentially repealed Obamacare and we will come up with something that will be much better. Obamacare has been repealed in this bill,  he added. Well, like most things Trump says, that s just not true. But, if the former reality show star could have done that in order to eradicate former President Obama s signature legislation, he would have and without offering an alternative.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told NPR that  This has not been a very bipartisan year. I hope in the new year, we re going to pivot here and become more cooperative. An Obamacare repeal in 2018 is DOA. Well, we obviously were unable to completely repeal and replace with a 52-48 Senate,  the Kentucky Republican said.  We ll have to take a look at what that looks like with a 51-49 Senate. But I think we ll probably move on to other issues. NPR reports:McConnell hopes to focus instead on stabilizing the insurance marketplaces to keep premiums from skyrocketing in the early months of 2018, a promise he made to moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine to get her support for the tax bill.On top of that McConnell broke with House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., on the approach to paring back spending on programs like Medicaid and food stamps. McConnell told NPR he is  not interested  in using Senate budget rules to allow Republicans to cut entitlements without consultation with Democrats. I think entitlement changes, to be sustained, almost always have to be bipartisan,  McConnell said.  The House may have a different agenda. If our Democratic friends in the Senate want to join us to tackle any kind of entitlement reform. I d be happy to take a look at it. This is coming from Mitch McConnell. He knows Donald Trump is destroying the GOP. It doesn t matter, Sen. McConnell. We still recall him saying that his  number one priority is making sure president Obama s a one-term president. Well, we re hoping that Trump doesn t last a full term. Funny how that works.Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",0
