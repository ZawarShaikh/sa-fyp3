the iron is completely ineffective it doesnt get hot enough to do a proper job and i have to go over the same spot multiple times to see any difference
quality is disappointing me
good product
worth of money
these cargos arent the worst but not the best
i didnt like how dry the kajal was it doesnt glide on easily and the pigmentation is not as rich as i expected
size is not same i am feeting its very big
very bad
color variation in tshirt i received and design print quality is worst its low quality paint print
good product but color is not that good it could be better
low quality thing its written room darkening but its transperant
good working
just okay
these curtains are perfect they keep the room dark and look amazing
okay
very cheap quality product
i purchased it on sales thinking i get a good discount but hell its price drop much after dilevary the dilevary of products is also slow but if i write about product it is good at use and after one or two weeks of use their is no problem
quality is not as per the expectations better quality cooler can be bought in same price range
plates are very small because of design plates are not flat so u cannot kept more food 10 inches plates not good for dinner 7 inch plates looks very small due to the shape quality was very good if u r looking for quality go for it only concern is size not quality
nice
very bad product
the size is smaller than i thought
these cushions are average in terms of comfort and support
cable is too short but doing good
low cost dslr superb good quality
so beautiful product
material is too bad
fragnance is so bad i cant wear a single time after i received this product
very bad
best
very low quality product material used is very low standard
this is the best kajal ive used so far rich color and no need for reapplication
theyre fine for simple everyday use but not ideal for special occasions
temp knob broke after sometime cable insulation also torn
it applies well but dont expect it to last through an entire day
good but not great
superb soft loved it
this is very very bad
this iron doesnt heat up evenly one side gets hotter than the other making it really difficult to iron clothes properly its frustrating to use
lekme kajal stays put even in humid weather iam really happy with its performance
ok
fabulous
I am extremely dissatisfied with the cushions quality theyre flimsy and dont provide support
mid range quality not much
kettle is good but the main problem is its lid which do not remain open while we try to fill it
the best part about this kajal is how long it stays on without any smudging
just good
best picture quality
its ok
the design is plain but works for a simple look
