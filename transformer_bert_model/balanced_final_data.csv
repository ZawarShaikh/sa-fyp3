simple it cant compete a desert cooler or ac if you actually cant manage desert cooler fixing on your window i mean if you are on first floor where there is no way to hang a desert cooler on your window then only go for it you cant sleep first 15 days with it due to bad smell and after 15 days you have to compromise with it good for places which has no option for ac or fix desert coolerso i have simply waisted money on it due to few chamcha reviews any how I have purchased ,negative

its a very good cooler quality water capacity is very good but it will be finished in few hours only it can make a big room cool only drawback is short power cord and its a bit noisy even in low speed over all its a very good product,neutral

flipkart delivered crompton desert air cooler 88 litres well before the schedule date before buying i compared with bajaj desert coolers here crompton seems to be much better based on the fan speed and quality water tank capacity of 88 litres is much needed crompton gives honey comb cooling pads for better cooling compared to wood wool it cools the room efficiently which makes us much comfortable in summer of chennai city,positive
great packaging by seller as this was the most important point while transportation from jaipur to chennai secondly product is quite huge and air throw is very much nearly 13ft at 2 speed and will give good breeze cooling is satisfying due to honeycomb cooling media no need of filling water daily price is high but product is quite satisfactory compared to others only drawback is the motor power is 190 w rather than 220w which should be coorected on specs information on flipkart good j,positive

the offer is very good you get two in a pack it is jet black and very pigmented and for a lasting effect it basically depends on the kind of climate you live in in winters it last long and similarly during humidity it kinda stays in place for atleast 2 hours but it doesnt make you look like a zombie tho lol end result i would say go for it girlsand this is my second purchase on the same product,positive
