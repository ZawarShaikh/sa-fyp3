connection cord is too small and uts causing difficulties to use it bcoz it carries 1500 v electricity and in market there is no extension cord available which can carry this much electricity

the kajal is smooth and glides well but ive noticed it doesnt stay on for the whole day
design is not so attractive got all pieces intact n cheap too overall okay product
not working properly within 10 months but its okay

the iron works fine for light use but it takes a while to heat up its good for basic ironing but might not be suitable for heavier fabrics
the pigmentation is amazing and it doesnt fade even after wearing it for hours
